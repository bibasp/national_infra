# Comprehensive Research on the Melamchi Water Supply Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The official name of this infrastructure project is the Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP). It is classified as a water supply infrastructure project designed to address the chronic water shortage in Kathmandu Valley. The Melamchi Water Supply Project has been officially designated as a National Pride Project by the Government of Nepal, highlighting its strategic importance to the country's development agenda and the high priority attached to it[^2].

## Geographical Coverage

The Melamchi Water Supply Project is located in Melamchi, Bagmati Province of Nepal. The intake of the project is situated in the Melamchi valley in the gorge below Ghwakan, just upstream of the confluence of Melamchi River and Ribarma Khola in Sindhupalchowk district[^1][^3]. The project diverts water from the Melamchi River through a 26 km tunnel to water purification facilities at Sundarijal in Kathmandu Valley[^1].

The project is designed to divert approximately 170 million liters per day (MLD) of fresh water to address the chronic water shortage in Kathmandu Valley[^1][^3]. The distribution network includes nine service reservoirs at various locations throughout Kathmandu (Mahankalchaur, Bansbari, Paani Pokhari, Balaju, Khumaltar, Arubari, Tigni, Katunje and Kritipur), connected by a Bulk Distribution System (BDS) from Sundarijal[^1].

## Timeline and Status

The development of the Melamchi Water Supply Project followed a lengthy timeline:

- Project started: 1998[^1]
- Loan approval by Asian Development Bank: December 21, 2000[^2]
- Loan effective date: November 28, 2001[^2]
- Project revision: After approximately 6 years of implementation (around 2007), the government recognized the necessity to change the project's scope[^2]
- Project completion: 2021[^1]

Currently, the project is completed, though there are reports of occasional suspension of water supply during monsoon seasons due to excessive slurry overload at the project's water headworks[^4].

## Financial Details

The financial structure of the Melamchi Water Supply Project involved multiple funding sources:

- Primary funders: Japan and the Asian Development Bank[^1]
- Funding breakdown:
    - 57% loan
    - 16% grant
    - 26% financed by the Nepalese government[^1]

The project faced significant financial challenges, including alleged corruption and mismanagement. The Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has filed a corruption case involving charges ranging from Rs 890 million to Rs 41.13 million against various officials and entities related to illegal payments from government resources[^4].

## Implementation Structure

The implementation of the Melamchi Water Supply Project involved several key stakeholders:

- Executing agency: Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport (Nepal)[^1]
- Implementing agency: Melamchi Water Supply Development Board[^1][^2]

The project had a troubled history with contractors:

- Initially, a Chinese company was hired but the contract was terminated
- In July 2013, an Italian company took over but this contract was also terminated in January 2019 due to unsatisfactory progress
- Subsequently, another construction company was engaged to complete the remaining works[^4]


## Technical Specifications

The Melamchi Water Supply Project incorporates several technical components:

- Diversion weir: A gravity concrete weir 5 to 7 meters high with the crest at an elevation of 1,425 meters above sea level[^1]
- Sediment exclusion: Double-chambered basins with a length of 80 meters each and a design capacity of 6 m³/s[^1]
- Tunnel specifications:
    - Length: 26 kilometers (the longest water supply tunnel in South Asia and second longest in Asia)
    - Cross-sectional area: 12.7 m²
    - Excavation method: Drill and blast
    - Elevation: Intake at 1,416 meters and outlet at 1,408 meters above sea level[^1]
- Distribution network:
    - Nine service reservoirs throughout Kathmandu
    - 670 kilometers of distribution pipes
    - 540 kilometers of sewerage network[^1]


## Socioeconomic Impact

The Melamchi Water Supply Project was designed to deliver significant socioeconomic benefits:

- Primary beneficiaries: Residents of Kathmandu Valley suffering from chronic water shortages
- Key objectives: Improving health and well-being of Kathmandu residents by providing reliable potable water[^2]
- The project aimed to alleviate the acute shortage of clean drinking water in the valley, which had been a persistent problem for decades[^2][^3]


## Challenges and Controversies

The Melamchi Water Supply Project faced numerous significant challenges during implementation:

- Contractor issues:
    - Early termination of contract with a Chinese firm due to sluggish progress
    - Subsequent contract with an Italian company also terminated in January 2019 due to unsatisfactory progress[^4]
- Corruption allegations:
    - Illegal payments made to contractors without proper adherence to legal protocols
    - CIAA filed a corruption case against 17 individuals and entities, including three former secretaries
    - Allegations of advance payments not properly deducted, resulting in losses for the state
    - Interest on illegal payments amounting to Rs 110.91 million reportedly not recovered
    - Failure to deduct Rs 100 million from provisional payments and to recover Rs 276.64 million for equipment left by the previous contractor[^4]
- Natural disasters:
    - Project affected by floods in June 2021[^4]
    - Suspension of water supply during monsoons due to excessive slurry overload at headworks[^4]


## Historical Context

The Melamchi Water Supply Project was conceived as the most viable long-term solution to the chronic water shortage within Kathmandu Valley[^3]. The project underwent significant revisions after approximately six years of implementation, with the government and ADB recognizing the necessity to change its scope[^2].

The project was split into three distinct components:

1. Melamchi Valley Subproject (Subproject I)
2. Kathmandu Valley Subproject (Subproject II)
3. Project Support (Subproject III)[^3]

Subproject I included the construction of the 26 km diversion tunnel, approximately 43 km of access roads, upgrading of about 29 km of road, construction of a water treatment plant, and implementation of a social upliftment program[^3].

## Future Outlook

While the main project has been completed, there are plans for future expansion:

- Potential additional water sources: Augmenting the supply by adding about 170 MLD each from the Yangri and Larke rivers, which are in the upstream proximity of Melamchi[^3]
- Treatment plant expansion: The water treatment plant was designed with an initial capacity of 170 MLD but is expandable to about 510 MLD to accommodate future water sources[^3]

Despite its completion, the project faces ongoing challenges with maintenance and operations, particularly during monsoon seasons when water supply may be suspended due to slurry overload issues[^4].

The Melamchi Water Supply Project, despite its troubled implementation history, represents a significant achievement in addressing Kathmandu's chronic water shortages and serves as both a cautionary tale and a critical piece of infrastructure for Nepal's development.
