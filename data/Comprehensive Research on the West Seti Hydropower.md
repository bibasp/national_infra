# Comprehensive Research on the West Seti Hydropower Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The infrastructure project is officially named the West Seti Hydroelectric Project (WSHEP). It is classified as a storage hydroelectric power plant, designed to generate substantial power for domestic use and export. The project is being developed on the Seti River in the Far Western Development Region of Nepal. While the search results don't explicitly mention a specific national planning designation, the project's scale and strategic importance suggest it holds national significance in Nepal's power development strategy.

## Geographical Coverage

The West Seti Hydropower Project is located in Dhungad Ward, Baitadi District, Mahakali Zone, Sudurpashchim Province of Nepal[^2]. The project is situated on the Seti River, with the power station positioned approximately 63 kilometers upstream of the Seti River's confluence with the Karnali River, and the dam site located a further 19.2 kilometers upstream[^3].

The project has an impressive planned capacity of 750 MW with an average annual energy generation potential of 3.33-3.636 billion kWh[^3][^4]. The geographical coordinates of the project are approximately 29.3681, 80.7915 (WGS 84)[^2].

## Timeline and Status

The project has had a lengthy development timeline:

- Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) commenced in 1997[^4]
- The EIA report was approved by Nepal's Ministry of Population and Environment in 2000[^4]
- In 2015, Investment Board Nepal received final approval from CWE Investment Corporation for the project[^3]
- At that time, the project was forecast to reach completion by 2021-22[^3]

Currently, the project is in pre-construction status according to the Global Energy Monitor's database[^2]. The timeline was significantly affected when China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC) backed out of the project in August 2018, claiming financial infeasibility, leading to the cancellation of the MOU with CWE Investment Corporation[^3].

## Financial Details

The West Seti Hydropower Project carries substantial financial implications:

- Estimated project cost: Approximately \$1.6 billion[^3]
- Funding structure: Originally planned as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model[^3][^4]

China Eximbank had reportedly agreed to provide \$1.6 billion in financing for the project, structured as half concessional loans (at less than 2% interest rate) and half commercial loans (with interest rates no higher than 7%)[^3].

In 2014, the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) requested a \$400 million concessional loan from the Chinese government to fund its 25% equity share in the project, but this loan was never finalized[^3]. The financial structure became uncertain after CTGC's withdrawal from the project in 2018.

## Implementation Structure

The implementation structure of the West Seti Hydropower Project involved several key stakeholders:

- Developer: Originally proposed by West Seti Hydro Limited (WSHL)[^1][^4]
- Planned ownership structure (before cancellation):
    - China Three Gorges Corporation (75%)[^2][^3]
    - Nepal Electricity Authority (25%)[^2][^3]
- Operating entity: West Seti Hydro Limited[^2]
- Joint venture company: West Seti Hydropower Project Development Limited was to be established to finance, design, implement, and maintain the dam[^3]

The Environmental Impact Assessment was prepared by Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) between 1996 and 2000[^1].

## Technical Specifications

The West Seti Hydropower Project features significant technical specifications:

- Dam: A 195-meter high concrete-faced storage dam with twin 12.8m diameter diversion tunnels and a concrete-lined ungated chute spillway[^4]
- Reservoir: Total storage capacity of 1,566 million cubic meters (926 million cubic meters of live storage and 640 million cubic meters of dead storage)[^1]
- Inundation area: 25.1 km of Seti River and a total of 28 km of five main tributaries (Chama Gad, Dhung Gad, Saili Gad, Nawaghar Gad, and Kalanga Gad)[^1][^4]
- Power generation: From a head of 259 meters, with peak generation flow of 330 cubic meters per second[^1]
- Tunnels: A 10m diameter and 6.7km long headrace tunnel leading to a vertical pressure shaft (167m deep) and pressure tunnel (365m long)[^4]
- Pressure system: The pressure tunnel will branch into five 3m diameter steel-line pressure conduits, one for each turbine-generator unit[^4]
- Turbines: 4 x 187.5 MW[^2]
- Re-regulation infrastructure: A re-regulation weir, covering 62ha at FSL, located 6km downstream of the tailrace outlet to regulate river flow[^4]
- Land requirement: Approximately 2,202 hectares for the reservoir, dam site, and spillway[^4]


## Socioeconomic Impact

The West Seti Hydropower Project would have significant socioeconomic implications:

- Resettlement: An estimated 1,579 households and 12,914 individuals would need to be resettled from the project site, with the majority requiring resettlement from the reservoir flood zone and no-habitation zone[^1]
- Compensation: The displaced households would be resettled to project relocation sites in the Terai with compensation for their lands and properties[^1]
- Power distribution: Plans included providing free electricity to locals, with 90% of the electricity to be exported to India through a 230-kilometer transmission line[^3]


## Challenges and Controversies

The West Seti Hydropower Project has faced several significant challenges:

- Financial feasibility: CTGC signaled to NEA that the power purchase rate for the project was too low, eventually backing out in August 2018 claiming financial infeasibility[^3]
- International relations: India's unwillingness to purchase power from the project was suggested as a reason for CTGC's withdrawal[^3]
- Environmental classification: The project was classified by Asian Development Bank as environment category 'A' primarily due to the magnitude of resettlement and adverse impacts on land use and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems[^1]


## Historical Context

The West Seti Hydropower Project has gone through multiple iterations over its development history:

- Initial development: The project was originally proposed by West Seti Hydro Limited on the Seti River in the Far Western Development Region of Nepal[^1]
- Partnership changes: CWE Investment Corporation (a subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation) and Nepal's Ministry of Energy later signed a Memorandum of Understanding to develop the project according to a PPP model[^3]
- Current status: After CTGC backed out in 2018, the Government of Nepal announced that the MOU with CWE Investment Corporation had been cancelled[^3]


## Future Outlook

The future of the West Seti Hydropower Project remains uncertain following CTGC's withdrawal in 2018. The search results don't provide recent updates on whether the project has been revived with new partners or under a new structure.

If eventually completed, the project would add 750 MW to Nepal's electricity generation capacity, potentially allowing for both domestic use and export. Originally, the power generation plan included providing free electricity to locals while exporting 90% to India, though India's willingness to purchase the power became a point of contention.

The project represents a significant potential contribution to Nepal's power generation capacity, though its implementation has been challenged by financial, geopolitical, and environmental considerations.
