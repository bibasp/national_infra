# Comprehensive Research on the Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel Infrastructure Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The infrastructure project is officially known as the "Samakhusi – Tokha – Chhahare Road Up-gradation Project," though it is commonly referred to as the "Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel" in most reporting and documentation[^1][^2]. This is a road infrastructure project that includes a significant tunnel component, forming a strategic transportation link between Kathmandu and northern areas of Nepal[^1].

While the search results don't explicitly mention a specific project ID designation in national planning documents, the project is classified as a strategic infrastructure initiative described as a "Strategic Material Transport Channel between Tibet and Kathmandu," highlighting its importance to Nepal's transportation network and international connectivity[^1].

## Geographical Coverage

The Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel project is located in Province 3 of Nepal, spanning Kathmandu and Nuwakot districts[^1][^2]. The complete alignment of the road up-gradation project follows the route: Samkhushi – Tokha – Samgla – Thana Bhanjyang – Hattigauda – Salyantar – Thapagaon – Thasing – Dhikure – Chhahare[^1].

The project starts from Tokha in Kathmandu and extends to Chhahare in Nuwakot, covering a total distance of 32-34.2 kilometers[^1][^3]. A key component of this project is the 4.175-kilometer tunnel on the Sangla-Salyantar section, which will significantly reduce travel distance and time between Kathmandu and Nuwakot[^1][^2]. The current road distance of 27 kilometers between Tokha and Chhahare will be shortened to just 4.17 kilometers with the tunnel construction[^2].

## Timeline and Status

The Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel project's formal inception can be traced to October 13, 2019, when Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal[^2][^3]. This agreement outlined China's assistance in constructing two stretches of road linking Kathmandu and Rasuwagadhi, with the Tokha-Chhahare section being one of them[^2].

Key milestones in the project timeline include:

- October 2019: Initial MoU signed between Nepal and China[^2]
- 2023: Feasibility study completed by a Chinese technical team (referenced as occurring in 2076 BS)[^4]
- September 2023: Ministry of Forests and Environment granted approval to proceed with the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)[^5]
- December 2024: Agreement signed with China for tunnel construction during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's visit to China[^4]
- March 2025 (current): Nepal plans to propose that China fund the Detailed Project Report (DPR)[^3]

The current status of the project as of March 2025 is that it remains in the planning and preparation phase. Despite government allocation of Rs 1 billion last fiscal year for preparation of the DPR and environmental impact assessment, work on these critical pre-construction elements has faced delays[^4]. A technical team from China Communication Construction Company is currently conducting a study of the tunnel[^3].

## Financial Details

According to initial project documentation, the estimated total project cost is USD 265 million (approximately Rs 31.8 billion at current exchange rates)[^1]. For the fiscal year 2023/24, the federal budget allocated Rs 1.94 billion for tunnel road development programs, with Rs 1.25 billion specifically earmarked for the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road[^3].

The project is planned to be implemented under a Public-Private Partnership (BOT - Build, Operate, Transfer) model, according to the initial project documents[^1]. China is expected to provide significant assistance for the project based on the 2019 MoU and subsequent agreements[^2][^4].

As of March 2025, Nepal is planning to request China to bear the expenses for conducting the Detailed Project Report of the tunnel, indicating potential Chinese funding for at least the planning phase[^3].

Financial progress is difficult to ascertain from the available information, as the project is still in pre-construction phases.

## Implementation Structure

The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport (MoPIT) is the primary implementing government agency for the Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel project[^3]. Arjun Jung Thapa, Joint Secretary at MoPIT, is mentioned as being involved in coordinating with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding this project[^3].

Currently, a technical team from the China Communication Construction Company is conducting studies related to the tunnel project[^3]. The Ministry of Forests and Environment is also a key stakeholder, as the project passes through the Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park area, requiring their approval for environmental assessments[^5].

The development modality described in project documents indicates that the government's role includes facilitation of legal approvals, government permits, and providing Right-of-Way, while the private sector's role would involve planning, designing, financing, constructing, and operating the project, including toll collection[^1].

## Technical Specifications

The Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel project follows specific design standards as outlined in the project documentation:

- Total road length: 34.2 kilometers[^1]
- Tunnel section: 4.175 kilometers on the Sangla-Salyantar segment[^1]
- Tunnel width: 10 meters[^1]
- Road cross-section: 8.5 meters (7-meter carriageway with 0.75-meter shoulders on either side)[^1]
- Design speed: 40 kilometers per hour[^1]
- Pavement structure: 5 cm Asphalt Concrete-13 fine graded asphalt mortar + Sealer + 20cm graded gravel + 20cm gravel soil[^1]

The project includes significant drainage infrastructure, with plans for one major bridge, 15 medium and small bridges, and 152 culverts across the entire route[^1].

A key technical challenge is the environmental sensitivity of the project area, as it passes through Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park, requiring special environmental mitigation measures[^5]. The Ministry of Forests has agreed to proceed with the EIA process under eight specific conditions, though these conditions are not detailed in the available information[^5].

## Socioeconomic Impact

The Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel project is expected to deliver significant socioeconomic benefits to communities in both Kathmandu and Nuwakot districts:

- **Improved connectivity**: The tunnel will significantly reduce travel time between Nuwakot and Kathmandu, benefiting both commercial transportation and daily commuters, including students studying in Kathmandu[^2].
- **Economic opportunities**: Local farmers in Nuwakot will gain better access to markets in Kathmandu, enabling them to export their agricultural products more efficiently[^2].
- **Land value appreciation**: Land prices in areas surrounding the project have already increased substantially. By 2019, land in areas such as Chhahare, Kaphaldanda, Thapagaun, Satdobate, Khanyachaur, Sattariphant, Thansingh, and Dhukure had reached approximately Rs 800,000 per ropani[^2].
- **Tourism development**: The improved connectivity is expected to boost tourism in Nuwakot, with potential to develop historical and natural attractions like the Seven-storey Palace, Dupcheshwor, Kakani, Devighat, Chiteshwor, Suirechaur, Chisapani, and Kutungsang as tourist destinations, particularly for Chinese tourists entering from the Rasuwagadhi border[^2].


## Challenges and Controversies

The Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel project has faced several challenges that have delayed its implementation:

- **Environmental concerns**: The route passes through the Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park area, requiring special permissions and environmental impact assessments. The Ministry of Forests has stipulated eight conditions that must be followed during the EIA process[^5].
- **Bureaucratic delays**: Despite the initial MoU being signed in 2019, progress has been slow, with the DPR and EIA still not completed by March 2025[^3][^4].
- **Funding uncertainties**: Though the project was announced with significant fanfare, the actual funding mechanisms have taken time to establish, with Nepal now looking to China to fund even the DPR preparation[^3].
- **Infrastructure deterioration**: The existing 27 km-long Chhahare-Tokha road is reported to be in a dilapidated condition, mainly due to the use of heavy vehicles, creating challenges for current users while the tunnel project develops[^2].


## Historical Context

The Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel project emerged as part of Nepal's broader strategy to enhance connectivity with China. The project was formally initiated during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal in October 2019, when a memorandum of understanding was signed for China to help build two stretches of road linking Kathmandu and Rasuwagadhi[^2][^3].

The tunnel represents a strategic investment in Nepal's northern connectivity, designed to serve as a material transport channel between Tibet and Kathmandu[^1]. After the initial MoU, the project has progressed through various administrative and planning phases, though at a slower pace than initially anticipated.

The political significance of the project is highlighted by the involvement of high-level officials, including the signing of a new agreement during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's visit to China in December 2024[^4].

## Future Outlook

As of March 2025, the immediate next steps for the Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel project include:

1. Securing Chinese funding for the Detailed Project Report (DPR)[^3]
2. Completing the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) with adherence to the conditions set by the Ministry of Forests[^5]
3. Finalizing technical designs and moving toward the construction phase

The project forms part of Nepal's strategy to improve connectivity with China, particularly enhancing the Kathmandu-Rasuwagadhi route[^2][^3]. Upon completion, the tunnel is expected to reduce both distance and travel time between Kathmandu and the northern border region, fostering increased trade and economic activities[^3].

The expected development period outlined in initial project documents suggests approximately 6 months for feasibility study, 6 months for business negotiation, 6 months for financial close, 6 months for investigation and detailed design, and 36 months for construction[^1]. However, given the delays already experienced, this timeline will likely be extended.

In the broader context of Nepal's infrastructure development strategy, the Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel represents an important component of the country's efforts to enhance north-south connectivity and strengthen economic ties with China, particularly as part of the Belt and Road Initiative framework.
