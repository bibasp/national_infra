# Comprehensive Research on the Sunkoshi Marin Diversion Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The official name of this infrastructure project is the Sunkoshi Marin Diversion Multipurpose Project (SMDMP), also referred to as Sunkoshi Marin Diversion Project (सुनकोशी मरिन डाइभर्सन आयोजना in Nepali). This is classified as a multipurpose infrastructure project with both irrigation and hydroelectric components. The project has been officially designated as a National Pride Project by the Government of Nepal as of January 20, 2020, highlighting its strategic importance to the country's development agenda[^1][^5].

## Geographical Coverage

The Sunkoshi Marin Diversion Project is located primarily in Sindhuli district of Nepal. It is an inter-basin transfer project designed to divert water from the Sunkoshi River to the Marin River, which is a tributary of the Bagmati River[^1][^5].

The 13.3-kilometer tunnel route stretches from Kusumtar in Kamalamai Municipality-2 to Kandhungri in Sunkoshi Rural Municipality-7 in Sindhuli district[^3]. Although situated in Sindhuli, the project will primarily benefit several districts in the Madhesh Province, including Rautahat, Dhanusha, Mahottari, Sarlahi, and Bara, by providing irrigation to 122,000 hectares of agricultural land[^1][^3][^5].

## Timeline and Status

The Sunkoshi Marin Diversion Project received National Pride Project status on January 20, 2020[^1][^5]. The tunnel breakthrough was achieved in August 2024, marking Nepal's second commercial tunnel route breakthrough, following the Nagadhunga-Sisnekhola tunnel which achieved the same feat just three weeks earlier[^3].

As of the Nepali date 2081/1/26 (approximately May 8, 2024, in the Gregorian calendar), the project website reports that the tunnel is 100% completed[^5]. This represents significant progress, especially considering that in April 2024, the tunneling work was reported to be over 50% complete, ahead of schedule by five months[^4].

A notable milestone in the project implementation occurred on January 5, 2023, when the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) became stuck at chainage 2+156 due to adverse geological conditions in the Siwalik Range, causing a collapse in the tunnel excavation area[^5].

## Financial Details

The Sunkoshi Marin Diversion Project has a substantial financial commitment, with a total project cost of NPR 83.39 billion, broken down as follows:

- NPR 37.2 billion allocated for irrigation components
- NPR 46.19 billion designated for hydroelectric infrastructure[^1]

The search results don't provide information about funding sources, international partners, or financial progress percentage.

## Implementation Structure

The implementation of the Sunkoshi Marin Diversion Project is led by the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation of Nepal[^1][^5]. Key personnel in the project management structure include:

- Mitra Baral, serving as the Project Director
- Amar Bahadur Chand Thakuri, functioning as the Information Officer[^5]

The primary contractors for the tunneling work are China Railway No. 2 Group Co Ltd and China Overseas Engineering Group Co Ltd, who have successfully managed the challenging tunnel excavation process[^4].

## Technical Specifications

The Sunkoshi Marin Diversion Project incorporates several advanced technical features:

- Design flow capacity: 67 m³/s[^1][^2][^5]
- Intake structure: A 12-meter high diversion dam on the Sunkoshi River[^1][^5]
- Tunnel dimensions: 13.3 kilometers in length, excavated using a 6.4-meter diameter Robbins Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM)[^4][^5]
- Power generation: The project includes a power station to generate electricity. There are some discrepancies in the reported capacity, with figures ranging from 28.6 MW to 38.62 MW across different sources[^1][^4][^5]
- Powerhouse location: Kamalamai municipality[^1][^5]

The tunneling process involved cutting-edge technology, with the TBM averaging a monthly progress of 833.3 meters and achieving a maximum of 1,136 meters in May. This project represents the first TBM tunnel to traverse the Kathmandu spiral geological structure and is the only high-buried, large-diameter single-head TBM tunnel currently under construction in Nepal[^4].

## Socioeconomic Impact

The Sunkoshi Marin Diversion Project is expected to deliver significant socioeconomic benefits:

- It will provide irrigation to 122,000 hectares of agricultural land across five districts (Bara, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Mahottari, and Dhanusha) in the Madhesh Province[^1][^3][^5]
- The project will contribute substantially to Nepal's long-term food security by enhancing agricultural productivity in the fertile plains of the Terai region[^3]
- The integrated power station will bolster the region's electricity supply, contributing to economic development and quality of life[^4]
- By diverting water from the Sunkoshi River to augment the flow of the Bagmati Irrigation System, the project addresses water scarcity issues in the target agricultural areas[^5]


## Challenges and Controversies

The Sunkoshi Marin Diversion Project faced several significant technical challenges during implementation:

- The tunnel path cuts through exceptionally difficult geological terrain, including high water inflow areas, rock extrusions, geothermal obstacles, rock bursts, and a fault zone[^4]
- The TBM encountered multiple stuck events, including:
    - On January 5, 2023, at chainage 2+156, where a collapse occurred in the tunnel excavation area. The geology showed poor lithology of mudstone with water on the left-top side of the face, while the rest was sandstone with highly developed joints[^5]
    - Another incident at chainage 9+226.988m, which was reported as the third stuck event since the beginning of tunneling[^5]

To overcome these geological challenges, the project team implemented various technical solutions including cutter adjustments, integration of over-excavation cutters, heightened grouting efforts, streamlined organizational processes, equipment maintenance, and efficient material supply management. The TBM's tapered design also proved valuable in reducing the risk of becoming trapped in challenging ground conditions[^4].

## Historical Context

While the search results provide limited information about the historical context of the Sunkoshi Marin Diversion Project, it's clear that the project represents an important milestone in Nepal's infrastructure development, being the second commercial tunnel route breakthrough in the country's history[^3].

The project appears to be part of Nepal's broader strategy to enhance water management through inter-basin transfers, addressing agricultural needs in water-deficient areas while simultaneously generating hydroelectric power.

## Future Outlook

With the tunnel breakthrough achieved and the project reporting 100% completion of the tunnel as of early 2024, the Sunkoshi Marin Diversion Project is positioned to deliver its intended benefits in the near future[^3][^5].

The completed project will:

- Augment water flow to the Bagmati Irrigation System, enhancing agricultural productivity across 122,000 hectares[^1][^5]
- Generate hydroelectric power through its integrated power station, contributing to Nepal's energy security[^1][^4][^5]
- Support Nepal's long-term food security goals by improving irrigation infrastructure in the fertile Terai plains[^3]

The successful implementation of this project demonstrates Nepal's commitment to developing multipurpose water resource projects that address both agricultural needs and energy requirements, serving as a model for future infrastructure development in the country.
