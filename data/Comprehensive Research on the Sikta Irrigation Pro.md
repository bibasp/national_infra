# Comprehensive Research on the Sikta Irrigation Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The official name of this infrastructure project is the Sikta Irrigation Project. It is classified as an irrigation infrastructure project and has been designated as one of Nepal's National Pride Projects, highlighting its strategic importance to the country's agricultural development agenda[^1].

## Geographical Coverage

The Sikta Irrigation Project is located in Banke District in western Nepal. The project's intake is positioned on the Rapti River, with its infrastructure spanning across six rural municipalities in Kohalpur municipality and Nepalgunj sub-metropolitan city[^1][^2].

The project consists of two main canals with a capacity of 50 m³/s each. The western section canal extends 45.25 kilometers while the eastern section canal runs 53 kilometers[^1]. The project is designed to provide irrigation facilities to 42,766 hectares of agricultural land throughout the region[^2].

## Timeline and Status

The development of the Sikta Irrigation Project has followed a lengthy timeline:

- 1980: Initial feasibility study conducted by Lahmeyer International GmbH from Germany[^1]
- 1983: The Department of Hydrology and Metrology revised the study[^1]
- 2004: The Irrigation Development Programme under the European Union concluded that the project was feasible, leading the government to initiate the project[^1]
- 2005-06: Project officially began[^2]
- Initial projected completion date: 2014-15[^1]
- First revised completion: Expected to be complete by 2020[^1]
- Current revised completion: Fiscal year 2032/33 as per the updated master plan[^2]

Current status as of March 2025:

- The project has achieved 92% physical progress for the fiscal year 2023/24 targets[^2]
- Overall project completion had reached 60% as of 2019[^1]
- Construction works are currently progressing on the Daduwa section canal[^2]


## Financial Details

The financial structure of the Sikta Irrigation Project has experienced significant changes over time:

- Initial budgeted amount in 2005-06: NPR 12.8 billion[^1]
- Current/revised budget: Exceeding Rs 52 billion total estimated cost[^2]
- Funding source: Government of Nepal's own resources[^1]

Current fiscal allocations:

- FY 2023/24 allocation: Over Rs 1.3 billion[^2]
- FY 2024/25 allocation (upcoming): Over Rs 1.6 billion[^2]

As of December 2023, expenditures had reached over Rs 760 million out of the allocated capital expenditure of over Rs 830 million for the fiscal year 2023/24[^2].

## Implementation Structure

The implementation of the Sikta Irrigation Project involves several key stakeholders:

- Primary contractor: CTC Kalika Joint Venture Pvt Ltd[^1]
- Consulting company: ERMC, with Uddhav Raj Chaulagai serving as managing director[^1]


## Technical Specifications

The Sikta Irrigation Project features significant technical specifications:

- Two main canals with capacity of 50 m³/s each[^1]
- Total canal length: 98.25 kilometers (45.25 kilometers western section and 53 kilometers eastern section)[^1]
- The canal system is constituted into 3 phases[^1]

Recent construction activities include:

- Contracting of remaining works for the eastern main canal and the Goha section[^2]
- Construction progress on the Daduwa section canal[^2]
- Land acquisition completed for construction of canals at Prasenipur, western main canal, Guruwagaun section, and various other sections[^2]


## Socioeconomic Impact

The Sikta Irrigation Project is expected to deliver significant socioeconomic benefits:

- Direct beneficiaries: Agricultural lands covering 42,766 hectares across Banke district[^2]
- Agriculture enhancement: Improved irrigation for farmers in six rural municipalities in Kohalpur municipality and Nepalgunj sub-metropolitan city[^2]

Land acquisition has been a significant aspect of the project's implementation, with recent completion of land acquisition for construction of canals at Prasenipur, western main canal, Guruwagaun section, and various other sections[^2]. However, there are ongoing issues related to the distribution of compensation for land acquired for the project[^2].

## Challenges and Controversies

The Sikta Irrigation Project has faced numerous significant challenges:

**Technical Failures:**

- Canal sections collapsed in 2016, 2017, and 2018 due to weak soil properties and cross-drainage problems, particularly near siphon areas[^1][^3]
- A government investigation revealed that failure to test the dissoluble soil during the design phase led to structurally weak canals[^3]

**Corruption Allegations:**

- The Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a corruption case of over NPR 2 billion against 21 defendants[^1][^3], including:
    - Bikram Pandey (former minister and chief of Kalika Construction): Claims of Rs 2.13 billion[^1]
    - Dilip Bahadur Karki: Claims of NPR 1.56 billion[^1]
    - Saroj Chandra Pandit: Claims of NPR 593.45 million[^1]
    - Uddhav Raj Chaulagai (managing director of ERMC): Claims of Rs 24.05 million[^1]

**Legal Developments:**

- The Special Court initially acquitted all defendants, attributing canal collapses to dissoluble soil rather than individual accountability[^3]
- CIAA appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the evidence had not been properly evaluated[^3]
- The Supreme Court ordered defendants to respond within 15 days[^3]

**Resource Constraints:**

- Inadequate budget allocations from the government have hindered project progress[^2]


## Historical Context

The Sikta Irrigation Project was conceived through a feasibility study conducted by Lahmeyer International GmbH from Germany in 1980[^1]. This was followed by a revised study by the Department of Hydrology and Metrology in 1983[^1].

The project gained momentum in 2004 when the Irrigation Development Programme under the European Union concluded that the project was feasible, which led the government to initiate the project using its own resources[^1].

## Future Outlook

Despite the challenges faced, the Sikta Irrigation Project continues to progress:

- Revised completion timeline: Fiscal year 2032/33 as per the updated master plan[^2]
- Increased budget allocation: FY 2024/25 budget increased to over Rs 1.6 billion, up from over Rs 1.3 billion in the current fiscal year[^2]
- Ongoing construction: Work is currently progressing on the Daduwa section canal[^2]

The project represents a significant investment in Nepal's agricultural infrastructure, with the potential to substantially improve irrigation capabilities in the Banke district upon completion.
