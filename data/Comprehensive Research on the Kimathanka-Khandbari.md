# Comprehensive Research on the Kimathanka-Khandbari Road and Bridge Infrastructure Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The official name of this infrastructure project is the Khandbari-Kimathanka Road, which forms a crucial section of the larger Jogbani-Kimathanka Road network. It is also commonly referred to as part of the North-South Koshi Road Project or the Koshi Corridor[^1][^2][^4]. This infrastructure is classified as a highway/road project and has been officially designated as a National Pride Project by the Government of Nepal, highlighting its strategic importance to the country's development agenda[^1].

## Geographical Coverage

The Khandbari-Kimathanka Road is located in Sankhuwasabha district in eastern Nepal's Koshi Province. The road extends from Khandbari (the district headquarters of Sankhuwasabha) to Kimathanka at the Nepal-China border[^1][^4]. The total length of this specific road section ranges from 158 to 162 kilometers, with slight variations reported in different sources[^1][^2][^4].

This road section is part of a larger 362-kilometer transportation corridor that runs from Biratnagar (near the Indian border) through Khandbari to Kimathanka (at the Chinese border), making it the shortest route connecting China and India in Nepal's eastern region[^3]. The road passes through several locations, including Chyamptang, Ghongghoppa, Hatiya, and Bhotkhola Rural Municipality[^1][^2].

## Timeline and Status

The Khandbari-Kimathanka Road project was initiated in the fiscal year 2065/66 (2008/09)[^4]. While the search results don't explicitly mention the initial projected completion date, the current revised completion deadline is set for fiscal year 2083/84 (2026/27)[^4].

Current status as of March 2025:

- A major breakthrough was achieved in January 2025 when the Nepal Army completed the excavation of a rocky cliff to finalize the 10.5-kilometer Chyamptang-Ghongghoppa section of the road[^1]
- The 134-kilometer road from Khandbari to Chyamptang has been built[^1]
- A 14-kilometer temporary track from Kimathanka to Ghongghoppa is operational[^1]
- The Nepal Army has completed constructing a 10.51-kilometer double lane road in the Chyamptang-Ghongghoppa section[^1]

According to the latest reports, the overall physical progress of the project stands at approximately 40% as of December 2024[^4]. Work on upgrading and widening the road is currently underway following the track opening[^1].

## Financial Details

The initial budgeted amount for the Khandbari-Kimathanka Road project was 16 billion Nepalese rupees[^4]. So far, approximately 5.58 billion rupees have been spent on the project, representing about 35% of the initial budget[^4].

Recent contract information includes:

- A contract worth 1.27 billion NPR awarded to Sharma and Company-Shivashakti JV for paving 39 kilometers of the road[^5]
- An 11-kilometer section contracted to Singh and Brothers-Dragon-Bibash International JV for 552 million NPR[^5]

In November 2024, during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's visit to China, the project was placed under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) framework[^4]. The Nepal government has requested China to fund the road upgrade through grants, but the funding modality (whether loans or grants) has not yet been finalized[^4].

## Implementation Structure

The implementation of the Khandbari-Kimathanka Road involves several key stakeholders:

- The North-South Koshi Road Project office has overall management responsibility[^1][^2]
- The Nepal Army has been tasked with constructing challenging sections of the road, including the recent breakthrough at the Chyamptang-Ghongghoppa section[^1]

Key personnel mentioned in the reports include:

- Ram Bahadur Gurung, serving as the Koshi Corridor Road Project Chief[^5]
- Pashupati Gyawali, who previously served as chief at the North-South Koshi Road Project[^2]

Multiple contractors are engaged for different sections of the road:

- Sharma and Company-Shivashakti JV for paving 39 kilometers[^5]
- Singh and Brothers-Dragon-Bibash International JV (though reportedly underperforming)[^5]
- Gajurmukhi Motidan Gitanjali Construction JV for segments connecting Barun-Simbung, Simbung-Hatiya, Lingum-Chepuwa, and Chepuwa-Hunghung[^3]
- Apex Kanchha Ram Construction for the Kimathanka-Chepuwa section[^3]
- Swochhanda, Yakthumhang and Pushpanjali JV for the Ekuwa-Hatiya road section[^2]

Government oversight includes the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, with Minister Devendra Dahal directly involved in project supervision[^1].

## Technical Specifications

The available information indicates that the Chyamptang-Ghongghoppa section has been constructed as a double-lane road[^1]. Current construction activities include:

- Laying base and sub-base before paving work begins[^5]
- Construction of retaining walls and culverts in specific sections[^3]
- Road widening following track opening[^1][^5]
- Graveling of specific sections, such as the 57.49 kilometers from Barun Bazar to Chemtang[^5]

The project has required significant engineering work to overcome challenging terrain, with explosive materials needed for sections with stiff rocks and cliffs, particularly in the Chepuwa-Chhumsur-Ghonggoppa road section[^2][^3].

## Socioeconomic Impact

The Khandbari-Kimathanka Road project has already begun delivering significant socioeconomic benefits:

- Strategic importance in facilitating tri-national transit, linking Nepal, India, and China[^1]
- Potential benefits for Bangladesh, bolstering regional trade and connectivity[^1]
- Creation of the shortest route linking India, Nepal, and China in the eastern part of the country[^3]
- Improved accessibility for local communities, dramatically reducing travel times to district headquarters[^2]
- Support for power infrastructure access, facilitating travel to Arun 3rd, Upper Arun, and Lower Arun Power Stations[^4]

Local communities have expressed satisfaction with the improved connectivity. As Aandi Bhote, Bhotkhola Rural Municipality-3 ward chair, stated: "The time to walk for days to visit the headquarters has gone"[^2]. Similarly, Mutuk Bhote of Bhotkhola Rural Municipality-4 expressed that "our days of sorrow had gone"[^2].

## Challenges and Controversies

The Khandbari-Kimathanka Road project has faced several significant challenges during implementation:

- Difficult terrain requiring explosive materials for construction, particularly in sections with stiff rocks and cliffs[^2][^3]
- Contractor performance issues, with some contractors failing to meet expectations or losing contact entirely[^5]
- Lack of construction materials and adverse weather conditions, including heavy rainfall, hindering work progress[^5]
- Particularly challenging rock sections, including a 6km portion at Sankhebhir and a 5km portion at Mahabhir[^3]
- Overall slow progress, with only 40% completion despite the project starting in 2008/09[^4]


## Historical Context

The Khandbari-Kimathanka Road project is part of Nepal's broader strategy to enhance connectivity with both China and India. The project was initiated in fiscal year 2065/66 (2008/09)[^4] and has evolved over time.

A significant development occurred in November 2024 when the project was placed under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's visit to China[^4]. At that time, the 'BRI Cooperation Framework' was signed between officials of Nepal and China, potentially opening new avenues for project funding and technical support[^4].

## Future Outlook

As the project moves forward, several key priorities remain:

- Target to pave 30 kilometers of road in the current fiscal year[^5]
- Completion of graveling for the 57.49 kilometers from Barun Bazar to Chemtang[^5]
- Continued widening of the road as construction progresses[^5]
- Request for Chinese support to build a concrete bridge along the border along with the road upgrading[^4]

Former Secretary Arjunjung Thapa has suggested that the remaining 100 km should be completed and upgraded with Chinese government support to maximize the project's benefits[^4]. With an expected completion by fiscal year 2083/84 (2026/27), this road will establish a strategic north-south corridor that connects China's transport network with India's, potentially transforming Nepal's position in regional trade[^4].

Physical Infrastructure Minister Dahal has assured that the government will ensure sufficient funding for completing the remaining sections, including constructing bridges along the route[^1], highlighting the project's continued priority status in Nepal's infrastructure development strategy.
