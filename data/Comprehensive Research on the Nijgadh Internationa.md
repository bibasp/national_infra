# Comprehensive Research on the Nijgadh International Airport Infrastructure Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The infrastructure project is officially named Nijgadh International Airport (Nepali: निजगढ अन्तराष्ट्रीय विमानस्थल), a proposed hub-airport that represents a significant aviation infrastructure development for Nepal. This project has been designated as a "National priority project" by the Government of Nepal, highlighting its strategic importance to the country's transportation and economic development agenda[^5].

## Geographical Coverage

The Nijgadh International Airport is planned to be located in Kolhabi, Madhesh Federal Province, in the Bara district of Nepal. The site is positioned approximately 68 km (42 mi) south of Kathmandu, near the town of Nijgadh[^1]. According to project plans, the airport would occupy approximately 2,556 hectares of land, with an additional 6,100 hectares allocated as airport area[^2]. In terms of land area, the proposed airport would be significantly smaller than the world's largest airports such as King Fahd International Airport (77,600 hectares) and Denver International Airport (13,571 hectares)[^2].

## Timeline and Status

The Nijgadh International Airport project has been in the planning stage for decades[^3]. In January 2016, Nepal's International Relations and Labour Committee directed the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation to immediately begin construction works, particularly focusing on the land acquisition process[^4]. The project was initially targeted to be completed by 2025 with a significant investment[^1].

However, the project has faced major setbacks. On December 6, 2019, the Supreme Court of Nepal halted the construction due to an improper environmental impact assessment (EIA). This was followed by a final verdict on March 26, 2022, that stopped all government decisions to build the airport[^1]. As of 2025, the project remains on hold awaiting parliamentary reassessment, though the connecting expressway to the proposed airport site continues to be under construction[^1].

## Financial Details

The financial estimates for the Nijgadh International Airport project vary considerably across different sources:

- The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment estimated the first phase would cost US\$1.172 billion[^1]
- A 2021 article cited a total project cost of US\$3.45 billion[^3]
- Other sources indicate an estimated investment of US\$6.7 billion[^1]
- The Investment Board Nepal lists the costs as US\$903 million for the first phase and US\$2.55 billion for the second phase[^5]

Regarding funding approaches, multiple strategies have been considered over time:

- In 2021, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal proposed building the airport using Nepal's own resources, suggesting an annual budget of Rs20 billion over 5-6 years would be sufficient[^3]
- In 2018, the government indicated plans to rely on private investment rather than providing funding directly[^4]
- In January 2019, Qatar proposed an international airport project in Nijgadh with an estimated investment of US\$1.2 billion[^4]
- The Investment Board Nepal indicates a BOOT (Build-Own-Operate-Transfer) modality for the project[^5]

As of 2021, approximately Rs2 billion had already been spent on initial works for the project[^3].

## Implementation Structure

The project implementation is primarily led by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) under the oversight of the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation[^3]. In 2019, the Investment Board Nepal reported that the project had attracted bids from six potential investors at the Nepal Investment Summit[^4].

Since the project remains in the planning phase and is currently on hold due to legal challenges, specific information about contractors, sub-contractors, and consulting firms is not available in the search results.

## Technical Specifications

The Nijgadh International Airport has been designed with ambitious technical specifications:

For the first phase:

- 3,600 x 45 meter double runway facility
- 3,600 x 23 meter parallel taxiway
- 22 aircraft stands
- 81,000 sq. meter terminal building
- Capacity to accommodate 6.7 million passengers annually[^1]

For the ultimate development:

- 720,000 sq. meter international terminal
- Capacity to handle 60 million passengers annually
- 174 parking bays capable of accommodating Airbus A380
- Two parallel 4,000 meter runways[^1][^5]

Additional features include:

- Four international terminals, each with 15 million passenger annual capacity
- Accommodation for "F" class aircraft
- 6 boarding gates, 34 check-in points, 6 security posts, 35 immigration stations, and 8 custom sections[^2][^5]


## Socioeconomic Impact

While detailed socioeconomic impact studies are not provided in the search results, the airport is positioned as a strategic move toward Nepal's prosperity[^2]. The project is primarily intended to address several key issues:

- Relieving capacity constraints at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu
- Establishing a hub airport to accommodate growing air traffic in the South and East Asian regions
- Addressing Nepal's future aviation needs, as passenger numbers are projected to exceed 15 million by 2030[^1][^4]

The airport, if constructed to its optimum scale and fully operational, would significantly enhance Nepal's aviation capacity, serving an estimated 60 million passengers annually[^2].

## Challenges and Controversies

The Nijgadh International Airport project has faced significant challenges:

- Legal obstacles: The Supreme Court of Nepal halted construction in December 2019 due to an improper environmental impact assessment, with a final verdict in March 2022 stopping all government decisions to build the airport[^1]
- Planning delays: The project has been stuck in the planning stage for decades[^3]
- Funding uncertainty: Various funding models have been proposed over time, from government funding to private investment to foreign partnership[^3][^4]
- Environmental concerns: While specific details are not provided in the search results, environmental issues were significant enough to prompt Supreme Court intervention[^1]


## Historical Context

The Nijgadh International Airport was proposed as an alternative to the existing Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu, which faces several limitations:

- Traffic congestion at TIA
- Limited passenger capacity
- Challenges in implementing precision approach procedures due to terrain
- Single runway operation (3,350m) at TIA, which is currently exceeding capacity[^1]

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Nepal's air traffic had experienced a notable growth rate of 9.2%, surpassing the average 7% growth in the Asia-Pacific region. The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal reported that passenger numbers at TIA doubled from 2009 to 2018, with the airport handling approximately nine million passengers annually[^1].

## Future Outlook

Despite the current hold on the project, infrastructure development related to the proposed airport continues:

- The 72.5 km long Kathmandu–Terai Madhesh Expressway is being constructed by the Nepali Army to connect the proposed airport site to Kathmandu[^1]
- A new international terminal is under construction at Tribhuvan International Airport, along with an extension of the parallel taxiway, to reduce traffic until the Nijgadh project can move forward[^1]

If the project proceeds after parliamentary reassessment, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal has estimated it would take approximately 7 years to complete[^3]. The development would significantly transform Nepal's aviation infrastructure, potentially establishing the country as a regional air transport hub while addressing the growing domestic and international air travel demands.
