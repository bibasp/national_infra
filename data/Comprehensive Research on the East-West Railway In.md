# Comprehensive Research on the East-West Railway Infrastructure Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The infrastructure project is officially known as the "East-West Railway Line" (पुर्व-पश्चिम रेल्वे in Nepali), also referred to as the "Mechi-Mahakali Railway." This is a Trans-Asian railway infrastructure project in Nepal[^1]. The railway has been officially designated as a National Pride Project by the Government of Nepal, highlighting its strategic importance to the country's development agenda[^1].

## Geographical Coverage

The East-West Railway will stretch 945.244 kilometers (587 miles) from the eastern Indo-Nepal border at Kakarbhitta to the western Indo-Nepal border at Kanchanpur[^1]. When completed, this extensive railway network will connect 24 districts across Nepal's Terai region. The railway will also intersect with the proposed Birganj-Kathmandu railway at a junction in Sarlahi district[^3].

The project is being constructed in nine strategic sections[^1]:

1. Inaruwa–Kakarvitta Railway Project
2. Inaruwa–Bardibas Railway Project
3. Bardibas–Simra Railway Project
4. Simra–Tamasariya Railway Project
5. Tamasiya–Butwal Railway Project
6. Butwal–Lamahi Railway Project
7. Lamahi–Kohalpur Railway Project
8. Kohalpur–Sukkhad Railway Project
9. Sukhad–Gaddachowki Railway Project

The ultimate plan includes subsidiary lines that will extend the total project length to 1,376 kilometers (855 miles)[^1].

## Timeline and Status

The concept of the East-West Railway was developed by the Nepalese government in 2007, with the Department of Railways being established in 2011 to oversee its implementation[^1]. Construction officially began in fiscal year 2067/068 BS (2008), though the project experienced significant delays due to various economic, environmental, and coordination challenges, pushing the active implementation phase to around March 2020[^1].

Current status as of March 2025:

- Overall physical progress stands at only about 4-7% after more than 15 years since inception[^2]
- Approximately 65 kilometers of track bed have been completed out of the total 925-kilometer project[^2]
- The Bardibas-Nijgadh (Chothakhanda) section shows the most progress, with 65 kilometers of the 69-kilometer railway track bed completed and 16 bridges constructed[^2]
- Most other sections have seen minimal advancement or have stalled entirely


## Financial Details

**Budget Evolution:**

- Initial budget estimate: 12 trillion rupees
- Current estimated cost: Approximately 15 trillion rupees[^2]

The cost per kilometer has increased from Rs 1 billion to Rs 1.5 billion[^3]. This dramatic cost increase represents a substantial escalation due to lengthy delays and inflation.

The government has consistently underfunded the project, allocating only Rs 1.5-2 billion annually[^2], despite department officials stating that a much higher allocation is required to maintain adequate progress. For the fiscal year 2080/081 (2023-2024), the government allocated just one billion rupees for land compensation[^2].

This funding shortfall has been particularly problematic for the Kakadbhitta-Inaruwa segment, where more than Rs 20 billion is needed for compensation alone[^2]. A major bridge across the Kosi River is expected to cost more than Rs 410 billion[^3], while the first Bardibas-Nijgad section alone will need an additional Rs 50 billion to complete[^3].

## Implementation Structure

The Department of Railways is the primary implementing agency for the East-West Railway project[^1]. Kamal Kumar Shah is identified as the spokesperson for the Railway Department in recent communications[^2].

The search results do not provide specific information about contractors, sub-contractors, or consulting firms involved in the project.

## Technical Specifications

The East-West Railway is designed to be a high-speed rail system capable of operating trains at speeds of 200 to 250 kilometers per hour[^3]. This ambitious infrastructure will include:

- 334 total bridges, with the longest spanning 1,171 meters over the Koshi River[^1]
- 10 tunnels with a combined length of 26.7 kilometers, including the longest tunnel measuring 17.742 kilometers[^1]
- 123 stations distributed along the route[^3]
- A dedicated 132kV transmission line to supply electricity to the locomotives[^3]
- A dam (purpose not specified in the search results)[^3]

When completed, this high-speed rail system would enable faster travel between major cities than air transport, at significantly lower costs[^3].

## Socioeconomic Impact

The East-West Railway project has far-reaching implications for Nepal's socioeconomic development:

**Expected Benefits:**

- Streamlined cargo and passenger traffic throughout Nepal's southern corridor[^3]
- Reduced transportation costs for imports and exports, particularly with India[^3]
- Environmental benefits through a 30% reduction in carbon emissions compared to trucks and buses[^3]
- Boosted tourism potential in the Kathmandu-Chitwan-Lumbini triangle[^3]

**Land Acquisition Challenges:**

- The project requires acquisition of approximately 4,520 hectares of land, including 518 plots belonging to 4,000 households[^3]
- Significant resistance has emerged from affected communities regarding inadequate compensation rates[^3]
- In multiple locations, such as Hariban village and the Dhanpati locality, residents have refused to accept compensation, claiming the offered amounts are substantially below market value[^3]
- Some farmers, like Dinesh Mahato from Ghurkauli village, express concern about losing their livelihoods without adequate compensation[^3]


## Challenges and Controversies

The East-West Railway project faces numerous significant obstacles:

**Major Implementation Barriers:**

- Chronically insufficient budget allocations that have hindered progress across all sections[^2]
- Persistent land acquisition and compensation disputes, particularly in the eastern section where construction has been halted for five years[^2]
- Environmental concerns regarding the railway's passage through Chitwan, Bardia, Banke, and Sukla Phanta National Parks and other protected areas[^3]

The project also faces skepticism from some infrastructure experts. Dr. Suryaraj Acharya has questioned the necessity and viability of the railway given Nepal's current infrastructure priorities, suggesting that "there is no need for this railway; it simply will not work" given the limited budget allocation[^2].

## Historical Context

The East-West Railway concept emerged as part of Nepal's strategy to develop alternative transportation networks and reduce dependence on India for international connectivity through ports like Kolkata and Vizag[^1]. The government formally established the project in 2007, creating the Department of Railways in 2011 to manage implementation[^1].

The network is ultimately expected to grow to 4,000 kilometers within 20 years[^1], forming a comprehensive national railway system.

## Future Outlook

Despite the slow progress to date, the East-West Railway remains a cornerstone of Nepal's long-term infrastructure vision:

- If completed, the railway would serve as Nepal's transportation backbone, offering faster and more affordable movement of goods and people than current options[^3]
- The high-speed trains would potentially connect major cities faster than air travel at much lower costs[^3]
- Railway junctions would facilitate north-south transshipment of goods and passengers when coordinated with other public transport systems[^3]

However, the project faces significant challenges to reach completion. At the current pace of budget allocation and with existing land acquisition challenges, the timeline for completion remains uncertain. The cost has already increased from Rs 12 trillion to approximately Rs 15 trillion due to delays[^2], and further delays will likely result in additional cost escalations.
