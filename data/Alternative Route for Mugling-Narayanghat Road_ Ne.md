# Alternative Route for Mugling-Narayanghat Road: Nepal's Strategic Transportation Bypass

The Alternative Route for Mugling-Narayanghat Road represents a critical infrastructure development aimed at addressing one of Nepal's most persistent transportation challenges. This project seeks to create a reliable bypass to the frequently disrupted Mugling-Narayanghat section, which has long been plagued by landslides and traffic congestion, particularly during monsoon seasons.

## Basic Information

### Official Project Name and Alternative Names

The project is officially known as the "Alternative Route for Mugling-Narayanghat Road" or the "Muglin-Gaighat-Dasdhunga-Thimura-Gaindakot Road"[^1][^3][^5][^8]. In government and media communications, it is sometimes simply referred to as the "Alternative to Narayangadh-Mugling Road"[^7].

### Project Type and Classification

This infrastructure initiative is classified as a highway development project, specifically designed as an alternative transportation route to relieve pressure on the existing Mugling-Narayanghat road section[^1][^2][^3]. The project involves constructing a new road alignment rather than expanding or upgrading the existing route.

### National Significance

While the search results don't explicitly designate this as a National Pride Project, its strategic importance is evident from the extensive government attention it has received. Home Minister Janardan Sharma emphasized the critical nature of this alternative route, stating that "only the expansion of the Mugling-Narayanghat section of the Prithvi Highway without first opening an alternative road was a mistake and that it cost lives of so many passengers"[^12].

## Geographical Coverage

### Provinces and Districts

The alternative route traverses through:

- Tanahun district (Gandaki Province)
- Nawalpur district (formerly part of Nawalparasi)
- Chitwan district (where Muglin is located)


### Specific Routes and Areas Affected

The road alignment passes through several key locations:

- Begins at Muglin
- Continues through Gaighat
- Passes through Dasdhunga
- Continues to Thimura
- Goes through Devpur in Devghat
- Terminates at Gaindakot in Nawalpur

Work has specifically begun from Puljeep in Aanboo Khaireni Rural Municipality-4, Tanahun[^1][^3][^5][^8][^10].

### Start and End Points

- Northern terminus: Muglin in Chitwan district
- Southern terminus: Gaindakot in Nawalpur district


### Total Length

The proposed alternative road spans approximately 38 kilometers from Gaindakot to Muglin[^5]. This route follows a different alignment than the existing Mugling-Narayanghat road, which is part of Highway H-05.

## Timeline and Status

### Conception and Planning

The need for an alternative to the Mugling-Narayanghat road has been recognized for many years:

- Local residents have long advocated for an alternative route[^1][^2][^10]
- By 2017, official discussions about alternative routes were documented[^9][^11]
- A Detailed Project Report (DPR) was conducted prior to awarding contracts[^1][^5]


### Official Start Date

Construction of the track officially began in February 2025, with foundation work starting at Puljeep in Aanboo Khaireni Rural Municipality-4, Tanahun[^1][^2][^3][^5][^8][^10].

### Current Status

As of March 2025, the project is in its initial implementation phase. Track opening work has commenced following the awarding of the first-phase contract by the Department of Roads[^1][^2][^10].

### Implementation Phases

The project is being implemented in phases:

1. Initial phase: Track opening from Puljeep in Aanboo Khaireni Rural Municipality-4
2. Subsequent phases: Connecting Muglin to Gaighat, Dasdhunga, Thimura, and Devpur before reaching Gaindakot in Nawalpur

## Financial Details

### Initial Budgeted Amount

The Department of Roads has allocated Rs 26.932 million for this project in the current fiscal year 2024/25[^1][^2][^3][^5][^8][^10].

### Funding Sources

The primary funding appears to be from the Government of Nepal through national budget allocations to the Department of Roads[^1][^2][^3][^5].

### Funding Partners

While the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is mentioned as potentially being involved in funding alternative routes to the Mugling-Narayanghat road, the search results don't explicitly confirm ADB's direct involvement in this specific project (Muglin-Gaighat-Dasdhunga-Thimura-Gaindakot)[^9][^11]. However, the ADB has committed Rs 50 billion for the construction of roads and bridges in Nepal, which may include components of this project[^11].

## Implementation Structure

### Implementing Government Agency

The Department of Roads, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is the primary implementing agency for this project[^1][^2][^3][^5][^8][^10].

### Consulting Firms

A Korean consultant has been selected for preparing the design of this and other alternative routes. The same consultant will also study seven various roads and three bridges in the country[^7][^11]. The Department of Roads was planning to sign a contract with this Korean company, though the specific name of the firm is not mentioned in the search results.

## Technical Specifications

The search results provide limited information about the technical specifications of this specific alternative route. However, we can note that:

- The project begins with track opening work, suggesting an initial focus on establishing the road alignment before full construction[^1][^3]
- The route will follow a path along Muglin-Gaighat-Dasdhunga-Thimura-Gaindakot[^1][^2][^10]
- The alternative road to the Narayanghat-Muglin section, described as "Muglin-Devghat-Gaindakot road will have to be constructed on the base of the hills along the opposite banks of Trishuli River"[^11]


## Socioeconomic Impact

### Expected Beneficiaries

The primary beneficiaries of this alternative route include:

- Local communities in Devghat, Gaindakot, and surrounding areas[^1][^2][^8][^10]
- General travelers who currently use the Mugling-Narayanghat route
- Religious tourists visiting Devghat, which is a significant pilgrimage site


### Economic Benefits

The project is expected to deliver several economic benefits:

- Enhancement of religious tourism in Devghat area, which is currently not connected to the national highway[^1][^2][^5][^8][^10]
- Potential for Devghat to become a hub for economic and religious tourism, as emphasized by Til Bahadur Thapa, Chairperson of Devghat Rural Municipality[^1][^5][^8][^10]
- Reduced economic losses from traffic disruptions on the existing route, which is frequently affected by landslides


### Impact on Local Communities

Local communities have been strong advocates for this project:

- Keshav Chandra Neupane, a resident of Devghat, praised the government for addressing the "long-standing demand from locals"[^1][^10]
- Til Bahadur Thapa, Chairperson of Devghat Rural Municipality, emphasized that since "Devghat Rural Municipality is not connected to a national highway, he believes that constructing a road from Gaindakot to Devghat and Dasdhunga will significantly increase tourist traffic and boost religious tourism in Devghat"[^1][^10]


## Challenges and Controversies

### Major Obstacles

The existing Mugling-Narayanghat road faces significant challenges that have necessitated this alternative route:

- Frequent landslides during monsoon season disrupting travel[^2][^8][^12]
- Growing traffic congestion (8,000-10,000 vehicles daily, expected to reach 15,000 in five years)[^7][^11]
- Safety concerns leading to loss of life, as pointed out by Home Minister Janardan Sharma[^12]


### Environmental Concerns

The search results don't specify environmental concerns related to this specific alternative route. However, the fact that the route will be constructed "on the base of the hills along the opposite banks of Trishuli River"[^11] suggests potential environmental considerations related to river ecosystems and hillside stability.

### Political Context

There has been political recognition of the importance of alternative routes:

- Home Minister Janardan Sharma stated it was "a mistake of the state administration not to open an alternative track along the Trishuli River"[^12]
- Lawmakers have "grilled Minister Sharma in the meeting for the government's negligence to safety of passengers on the road section"[^12]


## Historical Context

### Background of Project Conception

The alternative route emerged from persistent issues with the existing Mugling-Narayanghat road:

- Recurring landslides causing traffic disruptions and safety hazards
- Growing traffic volumes exceeding the capacity of the existing route
- Long-standing demands from local communities for an alternative solution[^1][^2][^10]

Home Minister Sharma notably stated: "Had we opened a road along the other side of the river prior to the road expansion, we could save many lives including those police personnel who died in landslides last month"[^12].

### Previous Attempts

Prior to the current initiative:

- The government had previously allocated funds for feasibility studies under earlier policies and programs, but later canceled the plan[^1][^10]
- The need for alternatives has been recognized since at least 2017, when alternatives were being officially discussed[^9][^11]


### Changes in Scope

This alternative route is one of two major alternatives being considered:

1. The current Muglin-Gaighat-Dasdhunga-Thimura-Gaindakot road
2. A rural road linking Malekhu in Dhading district and Bhandara in Chitwan, which is described as the "first choice" alternative[^7][^9][^11]

## Future Outlook

### Remaining Work

As construction only began in February 2025, most of the project work remains to be completed:

- Track opening is the current priority
- Full road construction will follow the established track
- Connection of Muglin to Gaighat, Dasdhunga, Thimura, and Devghat's Devpur before reaching Gaindakot in Nawalpur[^1]


### Connected Projects

This project is part of a broader strategy to address issues with the Mugling-Narayanghat road section:

- A second alternative route (Malekhu-Bhandara) is also being developed[^7][^9][^11]
- These alternatives complement ongoing expansion and improvement work on the existing Mugling-Narayanghat road


### Long-term Development Vision

The alternative route contributes to Nepal's broader infrastructure development strategy by:

- Addressing critical vulnerabilities in the national highway network
- Supporting economic development in previously isolated areas like Devghat
- Enhancing tourism potential for religious sites
- Providing more reliable transportation infrastructure that can withstand seasonal challenges

The existing Mugling-Narayanghat road is described as a "vital link till the completion of the proposed fast track and/or Kathmandu-Hetauda tunnel way, both of which are not likely to be completed in the next at least 10 to 15 years"[^6]. This underscores the importance of the alternative route as a medium-term solution to persistent transportation challenges in this critical corridor.
