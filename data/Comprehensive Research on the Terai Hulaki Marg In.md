# Comprehensive Research on the Terai Hulaki Marg Infrastructure Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The Terai Hulaki Marg, officially known as the Postal Highway (NH05), is a major transportation infrastructure project in Nepal. Previously designated as H17, it is also referred to as Hulaki Rajmarg or Padma Road in Nepali (हुलाकी राजमार्ग)[^3]. This infrastructure is classified as a national highway under Nepal's transportation network. According to Nepal's project database, it is designated as project ID TR-HW-003 in the national planning framework[^2]. The Postal Highway has been designated as a National Pride Project by the Government of Nepal, highlighting its strategic importance for national development[^5].

## Geographical Coverage

The Postal Highway runs across the entire Terai region of Nepal, spanning from Bhadrapur in Jhapa district in the east to Dodhara in Kanchanpur district in the far west[^3]. This extensive highway cuts across the entire southern width of the country, forming a crucial east-west corridor in the plains.

The highway connects 20 districts in the Terai frontier[^5], passing through major urban centers including Biratnagar, Rajbiraj, Siraha, Janakpur, Malangwa, Gaur, Birgunj, Parasi, Bhairahawa, Taulihawa, Nepalganj, Gulariya, and Dhangadhi[^3]. It follows a route very close to the Indo-Nepal border and runs roughly parallel to the existing East-West Highway, but approximately 20 miles further south[^4].

The total length of the highway fluctuates between 1,663 km and 1,792.42 km, as the government occasionally adjusts the route[^3][^4]. The most commonly cited figure in official documents is 1,792.42 km (1,113.76 mi)[^3].

## Timeline and Status

The Postal Highway has a long history, originally constructed during the Rana regime by Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana and Padma Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana to facilitate postal services throughout the nation[^3]. However, the modern renovation and expansion project commenced in the fiscal year 2009-10[^10].

**Key Timeline Points:**

- Initial projected completion date: Fiscal year 2017-18[^10]
- Revised completion deadline: Fiscal year 2079/80 BS (2022-23 in the Gregorian calendar)[^5][^10]

**Current Status:**

- As of January 2023, approximately 83 percent of the work on the Postal Highway had been completed[^5]
- Construction of 910 kilometers of road and 115 bridges had been completed by January 2023[^5]
- Status as of fiscal year 2019-20 (slightly older data): 54 percent completion with 512 km blacktopped, 288 km gravelled, and 95 of 219 bridges completed[^10]

According to project officials, it will take approximately three more years for the national pride project to reach full completion[^5].

## Financial Details

**Budget Evolution:**

- Initial budget estimate: Rs 47.27 billion[^10]
- Current/revised budget: Rs 65.20 billion[^10]

**Funding Sources:**

- Primary funding: Government of Nepal
- Foreign aid: Indian government contribution of Rs 8 billion for certain sections[^10]

The significant cost overrun of approximately Rs 17.93 billion (38% increase) can be attributed to several factors, including implementation delays, contractor issues, COVID-19 disruptions, and inflation over the extended timeline[^10].

While detailed financial progress percentage is not explicitly mentioned in the available data, the physical progress of 83% as of January 2023 suggests that a substantial portion of the allocated funds has been utilized[^5].

## Implementation Structure

The project is implemented by the Department of Roads under the Ministry of Physical Planning, Works and Transport Management (MoPPWTM)[^6][^7]. A dedicated Postal Highway Directorate oversees the project, with Dharmendra Kumar Jha serving as the project chief as of January 2023[^5].

Multiple contractors are involved in different sections of this massive infrastructure project. There have been notable issues with some contractors, including reports of an Indian contractor abandoning certain sections that were being built with Indian aid, which contributed to delays[^10]. Following this incident, Nepal and India reached an agreement to allow Nepali contractors to work on those highway sections[^10].

The project management employs consulting firms for detailed engineering studies and designs. For instance, specific bridges on the Hulaki Rajmarg have undergone detailed survey and design processes with technical assistance from consultants[^7].

## Technical Specifications

The Postal Highway is designed as a two-lane road connecting the Terai districts[^3]. While detailed technical specifications are limited in available sources, the project encompasses both road construction and bridge construction, with plans for a total of 219 bridges along the route[^10].

Bridge designs consider various factors including "the availability of skilled manpower, construction materials, condition of accessibility and other prevailing working conditions"[^7]. The engineering process for bridges includes detailed studies covering:

- Geological and geomorphologic assessments
- Topographical surveys
- Hydrological studies
- Seismological studies
- Environmental protection considerations[^7]


## Socioeconomic Impact

The Postal Highway is considered "a base for the prosperity of the Tarai Madhes" region of Nepal[^5]. While specific impact statistics are not detailed in the available data, the project is expected to significantly benefit the populations of the 20 Terai districts it connects.

The highway will improve connectivity between major commercial centers in the Terai, potentially boosting trade, agriculture, and general economic activities in the region. Its proximity to the Indian border also implies enhanced cross-border connectivity and trade potential with India, Nepal's largest trading partner.

## Challenges and Controversies

**Major Implementation Obstacles:**

- COVID-19 pandemic disruptions
- Disputes regarding project locations
- Border blockade issues[^5]
- Difficulty in securing construction materials
- Disputes about road borders in urban built-up areas
- Legal challenges in certain sections (court cases against construction)[^10]

**Contractor Issues:**
A significant delay occurred when an Indian contractor responsible for sections being built with Indian aid reportedly abandoned the project without completing the work[^10]. This situation was only resolved after Nepal and India agreed to allow Nepali contractors to take over those sections.

**Political Dimensions:**
There appear to be political dimensions to some of the challenges, particularly regarding land acquisition. These delays have been contextualized within "the larger context of political resistance of Kathmandu to greater linkages between Nepal and India"[^11]. Some sources suggest the project was not initially a political priority for the central government as it primarily benefited the Madhesi communities who sought better connectivity along and across the border with India[^11].

## Historical Context

The Postal Highway has deep historical roots as the oldest highway in Nepal, originally built during the Rana regime to facilitate postal services and transportation[^3]. The modern renovation project has its origins in 1991 when Indian Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar visited Nepal and provided assurances that India would support the project[^11].

The highway's development has been influenced by evolving Nepal-India relations and internal political dynamics, particularly regarding the Madhesi population in the Terai region. The project has undergone changes in scope, with route adjustments causing fluctuations in the total planned length over time[^4].

## Future Outlook

**Remaining Work:**

- Construction of approximately 250 kilometers of road yet to be contracted
- Completion of work on around 500 kilometers currently underway
- Construction of remaining bridges (approximately 104 bridges still needed)[^5]

**Current Fiscal Year Targets (2079/80 BS):**

- Construction of 27 bridges
- Blacktopping of 160 km of road[^5]

The Directorate has adopted a more stringent approach to project management, with provisions to penalize contractors who fail to complete work within deadlines. According to Chief Jha, "the contract would be canceled if work is not carried out as per the schedule"[^5].

Upon completion, the Postal Highway will provide a crucial transportation artery across Nepal's Terai region, potentially transforming economic activities and quality of life for millions of residents. Its strategic location near the Indian border positions it as an important element in Nepal's broader infrastructure development strategy, particularly for enhancing cross-border connectivity and trade with India.
