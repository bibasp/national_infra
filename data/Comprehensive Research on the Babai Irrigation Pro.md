# Comprehensive Research on the Babai Irrigation Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The official name of this infrastructure project is the Babai Irrigation Project (बबई सिचाई आयोजना in Nepali). It is classified as an irrigation infrastructure project designed to utilize water from the Babai River. The project has been officially designated as one of Nepal's National Pride Projects, highlighting its strategic importance to the country's agricultural development and food security agenda[^1].

## Geographical Coverage

The Babai Irrigation Project is located in western Nepal, though the specific province and district are not mentioned in the available information. The project aims to irrigate a total of 36,000 hectares of agricultural land by using water from the Babai River. More specifically, it is designed to irrigate approximately 21,000 hectares on the eastern side and 15,000 hectares on the western side of the river[^1].

## Timeline and Status

The development of the Babai Irrigation Project has followed a lengthy timeline, with dates provided in the Bikram Sambat (BS) calendar:

- Initial planning: The master plan study was completed in 2024 BS (approximately 1967-1968 CE)
- First stage:
    - Feasibility study conducted in 2035 BS (approximately 1978-1979 CE)
    - Detailed engineering completed in 2040 BS (approximately 1983-1984 CE)
- Implementation:
    - After the World Bank declined to fund the project in 2046 BS (approximately 1989-1990 CE), a district-level committee initiated the work
    - Highway weir cum bridge over the Babai River was completed in 2049 BS (approximately 1992-1993 CE)
    - By 2050 BS (approximately 1993-1994 CE), 5.5 km of canal was constructed, and traditional canals were fed to irrigate about 4,000 hectares
    - From 2051 BS to 2058 BS (approximately 1994-2001 CE), 28 km of canal was constructed
- Second stage:
    - Design works were concluded in 2058 BS (approximately 2001-2002 CE)
    - As of 2020, this stage was still ongoing, with studies being carried out for the canal from chainage 28 km to 43 km[^1]

The current status as of the available information (2020) indicates that the project is still in progress.

## Financial Details

According to the available information, the total estimated cost of the Babai Irrigation Project is approximately NPR 17,340,000,000 (17.34 billion Nepalese Rupees)[^1]. The search results don't provide details on funding sources after the World Bank declined to finance the project in 2046 BS, though it appears that domestic resources have been utilized since then.

## Implementation Structure

The Babai Irrigation Project is implemented by the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation of Nepal[^1]. No information is provided in the search results about primary contractors, sub-contractors, consulting firms, or the detailed project management structure.

## Technical Specifications

The search results provide limited technical information about the Babai Irrigation Project. What is known is that the project involved the construction of a highway weir cum bridge over the Babai River, which was completed in 2049 BS. The project also integrated pre-existing traditional canal systems including Budhi kulo, Majro Kulo, Raj Kulo, and Dhadhawar kulo[^1].

## Socioeconomic Impact

While specific socioeconomic impact data is not provided in the search results, the project's scale suggests significant benefits for agricultural communities in western Nepal. With a target of irrigating 36,000 hectares of land, the project would substantially enhance agricultural productivity and food security in the region.

## Challenges and Controversies

The most notable challenge mentioned in the search results was the World Bank's decision in 2046 BS (approximately 1989-1990 CE) to decline funding for the project. This led to a shift in implementation approach, with a district-level committee taking on the responsibility to initiate the work using presumably domestic resources[^1].

## Historical Context

The Babai Irrigation Project has roots dating back to at least 2024 BS (approximately 1967-1968 CE) when the master plan study was conducted. The project appears to have built upon traditional irrigation systems, as evidenced by the integration of pre-existing canals (Budhi kulo, Majro Kulo, Raj Kulo, and Dhadhawar kulo) which were fed to irrigate about 4,000 hectares by 2050 BS[^1].

The project's evolution from initial planning in the late 1960s to ongoing implementation in 2020 reflects the long-term nature of large-scale irrigation infrastructure development in Nepal.

## Future Outlook

As of the most recent available information (2020), studies were being carried out for the canal extension from chainage 28 km to 43 km, indicating continued development activities[^1]. The project's designation as a National Pride Project suggests its ongoing significance within Nepal's broader infrastructure development strategy.

The Babai Irrigation Project is related to the Bheri Babai Diversion Multipurpose Project[^1], which is another National Pride Project located in Bheriganga Municipality of Surkhet district, Karnali Province[^2]. This related project aims to channel water from the Bheri River into the Babai River for irrigation and power generation, potentially enhancing the overall water management system in the region.
