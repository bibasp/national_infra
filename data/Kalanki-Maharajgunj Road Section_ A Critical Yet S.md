# Kalanki-Maharajgunj Road Section: A Critical Yet Stalled Infrastructure Project

The Kalanki-Maharajgunj Road Section represents a crucial yet persistently delayed component of Kathmandu's urban transportation network. As the second phase of the Kathmandu Ring Road Improvement Project, this expansion was intended to build upon the success of the completed Koteshwor-Kalanki section. However, despite years of planning and site preparation, actual construction remains in limbo, resulting in significant environmental, health, and economic impacts for local residents who continue to endure dust, pollution, and traffic congestion along this critical urban corridor.

## Basic Information

The infrastructure initiative is officially known as the "Kalanki-Maharajgunj Road Section," constituting a key segment of the "Second Phase of the Kathmandu Ring Road Improvement Project." This project is classified as a highway/road expansion initiative, designed to enhance urban mobility within Nepal's capital city. While the search results don't explicitly identify it as a National Pride Project, its strategic importance as part of Kathmandu's primary circular road network underscores its significance for urban transportation.

The project was originally conceived to extend from Kalanki to Dhobikhola (Chabahil), though the Chinese implementation partner subsequently expressed interest in limiting their involvement to the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, citing land acquisition challenges beyond Maharajgunj. This reduced scope has created some ambiguity about the project's ultimate boundaries and implementation approach.

## Geographical Coverage

The Kalanki-Maharajgunj Road Section is situated entirely within Kathmandu district in Bagmati Province. As its name suggests, the project starts at Kalanki junction (where the first phase of Ring Road expansion ended) and extends northward through Balaju to Maharajgunj.

Multiple sources cite slightly different measurements for the project length. The section is predominantly described as spanning 8.2 kilometers from Kalanki to Maharajgunj, though some references indicate an 11.6-kilometer stretch when including the potential extension to Dhobikhola (Chabahil). The current focus appears to be on the 8.2-kilometer section to Maharajgunj, with future plans for the remaining section to Chabahil still uncertain.

Key areas affected by this project include densely populated urban neighborhoods along the Ring Road, notably sections near Swayambhu, Balaju, Gongabu Chowk, Basundhara, and Narayan Gopal Chowk, before reaching Maharajgunj.

## Timeline and Status

The Kalanki-Maharajgunj Road Section has experienced a protracted and troubled development timeline:

The project was formalized in February 2018 when the Government of Nepal signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China for the expansion of the Kalanki-Maharajgunj-Dhobikhola section of the Ring Road under the second phase of the Kathmandu Ring Road Improvement Project[^4]. According to this agreement, the road section was supposed to be completed within two years, suggesting an original completion target of early 2020.

However, as of March 2025, construction has yet to begin despite extensive site preparation. The project has faced multiple delays:

- Initial delays occurred due to site clearance challenges
- The COVID-19 pandemic further postponed implementation starting in 2020
- Even after pandemic restrictions eased and site preparation advanced, the Chinese implementation team has not arrived to commence construction

Current status reports indicate that approximately 80% of the construction site has been cleared, including relocating temples near Gongabu Chowk, moving electricity poles near Swayambhu, and clearing land near Basundhara bus stop[^1]. Despite this preparation, actual road construction remains at 0% completion as the project awaits the arrival of the Chinese contractor.

The most recent significant development occurred in February 2023, when top officials from Nepal's government and the Chinese embassy, along with stakeholders, inspected the 8.2 km project site[^6]. While this inspection suggested renewed interest, no concrete progress has followed in the subsequent two years.

## Financial Details

The financial aspects of the Kalanki-Maharajgunj Road Section project remain somewhat preliminary due to the lack of construction progress. According to initial estimates, the expansion of the Kalanki-Maharajgunj ring road section will cost approximately 6 billion Nepali rupees (6 Arba rupees)[^3]. However, this figure may require revision as the final detailed project report (DPR) has not been completed.

The funding structure follows the model established during the first phase of Ring Road expansion, with the Chinese government providing financial assistance. The project is expected to be implemented as a grant assistance project from China, similar to the completed Koteshwor-Kalanki section.

Despite the commitment of funds, financial progress stands effectively at zero since construction has not commenced. The only financial expenditures thus far would be related to site preparation and preliminary work by the Nepali government, including the construction of some service lanes along portions of the route.

A complicating factor is that despite the memorandum of understanding signed in 2018, the two sides have yet to finalize a "project implementation agreement" for this section[^4]. Government officials have indicated that construction can only begin once such an agreement is reached.

## Implementation Structure

The Kalanki-Maharajgunj Road Section falls under the oversight of Nepal's Department of Roads, with the Kathmandu Ring Road Improvement Project office handling direct management responsibilities. Key officials involved in the project include:

- Ramhari Pokharel: Director General of the Department of Roads
- Bijay Jaisi: Deputy Director General at the Department of Roads and Chief of the Development Assistance Division
- Krishnanath Ojha: Senior Divisional Engineer and head of the Kathmandu Ring Road Improvement Plan
- Ram Bihari Chowdhury: Information Officer of the Kathmandu Ring Road Improvement Project

Unlike many infrastructure projects where contractors have been selected and are actively working, this project remains in pre-implementation phases. The Chinese side is expected to manage all aspects of implementation, including "DPR, contractor, supervision, and construction materials"[^3], but has not yet mobilized to begin work.

In the interim, the Department of Roads has contracted separately for the construction of service lanes from Kalanki to Basundhara, with approximately 3 kilometers already completed[^4]. This work is proceeding independently of the main road expansion, which awaits Chinese implementation.

## Technical Specifications

The planned technical specifications for the Kalanki-Maharajgunj Road Section follow an ambitious urban highway design:

The current four-lane road is planned for expansion to eight lanes along most of the route, with some sections reaching ten lanes through the addition of service roads on either side[^4]. This differential width approach recognizes varying traffic demands and available space along different segments of the route.

Preliminary designs include the construction of sky bridges at three different locations within the section[^3]. These elevated crossings would improve pedestrian safety and traffic flow at key intersections, addressing criticisms of the first phase Ring Road expansion, which was widely criticized for being unsafe for pedestrians.

Environmental considerations have been a subject of controversy, particularly regarding the planned removal of trees. In 2019, the Department of Roads unveiled plans to cut down 2,057 trees along the 8.2km Kalanki-Balaju-Maharajgunj road section[^5]. This prompted protests from environmentalists, urban planners, and activists who urged authorities to make the new section "more public centric than vehicle centric" and to avoid repeating mistakes made during the first phase expansion.

While the Chinese team has conducted an initial survey and study of the area, the final design details remain pending. Local officials have submitted recommendations regarding the design to the Chinese Embassy, but the detailed project report (DPR) has not been finalized[^4], leaving many technical specifications subject to revision.

## Socioeconomic Impact

The prolonged delay in implementing the Kalanki-Maharajgunj Road Section expansion has created significant negative impacts for local communities, while the potential benefits remain unrealized.

Current impacts on local residents are overwhelmingly negative:

- Areas along the route have become notoriously polluted due to dust from partially cleared construction sites
- Local health concerns have risen due to poor air quality along the corridor
- Traffic congestion remains severe, with the route serving as a major transportation artery for the city
- Businesses along the route have suffered from the uncertain conditions and poor accessibility

The project's indefinite delay prompted dramatic action from local authorities. In May 2024, Kathmandu Metropolitan City dumped dust in front of the Department of Roads and the Road Division Office to protest the delay, arguing that "the unfinished road has become extremely dusty, and the dust pollution has severely affected public health"[^4].

In terms of land acquisition and resettlement, significant progress has been made in clearing structures from the project route. Officials report that approximately 80% of the required land has been cleared[^1], though some houses near Narayan Gopal Chowk in Maharajgunj still need to be removed[^4]. The temple near Gongabu Chowk has been demolished, and electricity poles near Swayambhu have been relocated to facilitate the future expansion.

Once completed, the project is expected to benefit hundreds of thousands of daily commuters by improving traffic flow, reducing travel times, and enhancing safety. However, these benefits remain theoretical as long as construction remains stalled.

## Challenges and Controversies

The Kalanki-Maharajgunj Road Section project has faced multiple significant challenges that have effectively prevented its implementation for over seven years since the initial agreement.

The most pressing current challenge is the lack of engagement from the Chinese implementation partner. Despite repeated outreach from Nepali officials, "the Chinese side has not been in contact lately"[^3]. This diplomatic impasse has created a frustrating situation where site preparation is largely complete, but construction cannot proceed without the Chinese contractor's arrival.

The project's troubled history includes several major obstacles:

- Initial delays stemmed from site clearance issues in the densely populated urban corridor
- The COVID-19 pandemic further postponed implementation from 2020 onward
- Environmental concerns arose regarding the planned removal of 2,057 trees along the route
- Technical design completion and approval remains pending
- Diplomatic complications have prevented the finalization of implementation agreements

The environmental impact of the proposed design prompted significant protest in 2019, when environmentalists, urban planners, and activists organized demonstrations along the Ring Road. These advocates warned against repeating mistakes from the first phase (Koteshwor-Kalanki section), which "has turned into a killer road" with a "faulty design" that prioritized vehicles over pedestrians and cyclists[^5].

The project's delays have also triggered a diplomatic dimension. In January 2025, when the Chinese Embassy in Nepal sought permission to celebrate Chinese New Year with an event in central Kathmandu, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City suggested holding it along the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section instead[^7]. While officials denied any sarcastic intent, many interpreted this as a pointed reminder about the unfinished project, suggesting "if this road isn't good enough for residents, it's certainly not good enough for a high-profile celebration"[^7].

## Historical Context

The Kalanki-Maharajgunj Road Section exists within the broader context of Kathmandu's Ring Road development, which has evolved over several decades.

The original Ring Road was constructed in 1977 with Chinese assistance, establishing a circular route around Kathmandu that has served as a crucial transportation corridor for nearly five decades. As Kathmandu's population and vehicle numbers have grown exponentially, the original four-lane design has proven increasingly inadequate.

The current project represents the second phase of a comprehensive modernization effort. The first phase, covering the Koteshwor to Kalanki section, was completed by China and handed over to Nepal in 2018[^7]. While this first phase successfully expanded the road to eight lanes, it received significant criticism for prioritizing vehicle movement over pedestrian safety and environmental considerations.

Learning from these criticisms, design conversations for the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section have included more emphasis on pedestrian infrastructure and environmental concerns. Activists have specifically called for "a dedicated bus-lane, a cycle lane and a wide enough footpath for pedestrians"[^5] to create a more balanced transportation corridor.

The agreement for this second phase was formalized in February 2018, with an original expectation of completion within two years. However, the project has repeatedly stalled due to site clearance challenges, pandemic disruptions, and most recently, an apparent lack of engagement from the Chinese implementation partner despite site readiness.

## Future Outlook

The future of the Kalanki-Maharajgunj Road Section remains uncertain despite repeated attempts to revitalize the project. As of March 2025, several components must still be addressed before progress can resume:

The most critical pending step is the arrival of the Chinese contractor to begin actual construction. Despite site preparation being approximately 80% complete, construction cannot commence until the Chinese team finalizes designs and mobilizes resources. Government officials note that they have "coordinated at every level and are ready to support the project"[^7], but the response from China remains pending.

In the interim, parallel work continues on service lanes along portions of the route. Local contractors are working on these auxiliary roads, with completion estimated by June 2025[^7]. However, these represent only a small portion of the overall project scope.

Recent agreements under the Belt and Road Initiative have rekindled hopes that work might finally begin, though no specific timeline has been established. The project's future may depend on broader diplomatic relations between Nepal and China, as infrastructure development has become increasingly intertwined with geopolitical considerations.

If implemented according to current discussions, the project would transform the corridor into an eight-lane main road with additional service lanes in certain sections. The design would include sky bridges at three locations to improve pedestrian safety, potentially addressing criticisms of the first phase expansion.

For residents along the route who have endured years of dust, pollution, and traffic congestion while awaiting improvements, the project's completion cannot come soon enough. Yet the path forward remains obscured by diplomatic complexities and implementation challenges that have plagued this initiative for over seven years since its initial agreement.

## Conclusion

The Kalanki-Maharajgunj Road Section exemplifies both the ambition and challenges of urban infrastructure development in Nepal. As a critical component of Kathmandu's Ring Road network, this project promises significant benefits for traffic flow, urban mobility, and quality of life. However, its implementation has been repeatedly stalled by a combination of practical obstacles, pandemic disruptions, and apparent diplomatic complications.

The prolonged delay has created substantial negative impacts for local communities, who have endured deteriorating conditions along a partially prepared construction route without seeing progress toward actual improvements. This has prompted increasingly dramatic protests from local authorities, including the symbolic dumping of dust at government offices to highlight the health impacts of the project's stagnation.

As Nepal continues to develop its urban infrastructure, the lessons from this troubled project highlight the importance of clear implementation agreements, sustained diplomatic engagement, and balancing multiple priorities including vehicle movement, pedestrian safety, and environmental protection. The eventual resolution of the Kalanki-Maharajgunj Road Section's challenges will not only improve a critical transportation corridor but potentially establish better models for future infrastructure collaboration between Nepal and its international partners.
