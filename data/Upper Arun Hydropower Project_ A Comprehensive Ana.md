# Upper Arun Hydropower Project: A Comprehensive Analysis

The Upper Arun Hydropower Project represents one of Nepal's most significant and strategically important energy infrastructure developments. With a planned capacity exceeding 1,000 MW, this project stands to substantially transform Nepal's domestic electricity supply and potentially establish the country as a meaningful regional energy exporter. Despite its promise, the project faces complex challenges including political complications, international concerns, and substantial technical hurdles.

## Basic Information

The official name of this infrastructure initiative is the "Upper Arun Hydro Electric Project," frequently abbreviated as UAHEP. Classified as a Run-of-River type hydroelectric project with 6 hours peaking capacity, it represents a significant advancement in Nepal's hydropower sector. The project is designed with an optimized generating capacity of 1,061 MW, though some sources reference it as 1,063 MW or 1,063.36 MW[^1][^2][^6].

The Government of Nepal has designated the Upper Arun Hydropower Project as a "Game Changer Project" (GCP) among hydroelectric projects due to its relatively low cost of generation and availability of abundant firm energy[^1]. While not explicitly labeled as a National Pride Project in the search results, its strategic importance and scale suggest considerable national significance within Nepal's energy development framework.

## Geographical Coverage

The Upper Arun Hydropower Project is situated on the Arun River basin in Koshi Province, Nepal[^4]. Specifically, the project is located in Bhotkhola Rural Municipality of Sankhuwasabha district, approximately 15 kilometers from the Chinese border[^6][^7]. The project affects ward numbers 2, 4, and 5 of Bhotkhola Rural Municipality, where land acquisition has taken place[^3].

For infrastructure development purposes, a 21-kilometer access road is being constructed, connecting the powerhouse to the dam site. This vital road starts from Chongrang, near Gola Bazaar in Bhotkhola-4, and extends to the dam site in Chepuwa village, Ward 2[^2]. The road includes two kilometers of tunnels to navigate the challenging terrain of this remote region[^2].

The project's designed capacity is 1,061 MW, with an expected annual energy generation of 4,512 GWh, of which 27.7% would be dry season energy[^1]. This significant capacity makes it one of the largest hydropower projects under development in Nepal.

## Timeline and Status

While the search results don't provide the initial conception date of the project, construction activities are now underway. The project is currently focused on developing critical access infrastructure. According to GlobalData, the project is officially classified as "under construction"[^4].

Construction of the 21-kilometer access road has gained momentum, as reported in December 2024[^2]. To bridge the gap from the Koshi Highway, which currently reaches Chongrang, the project is building a 70-meter-long steel arch bridge over the Arun River[^2].

The construction timeline indicates:

- Construction start: 2024[^3]
- Expected commissioning: 2028[^4], though some sources suggest power generation might begin from 2030[^3]

The project has faced an 18-month delay due to prolonged approval processes for using national forest land and clearing trees[^2]. More recently, construction has reportedly "come to a standstill" due to political interference and concerns raised by neighboring India and international lenders[^6].

Currently, 64% of land compensation has been settled[^3], and access road construction is progressing despite the challenging terrain requiring airlift of heavy equipment via helicopters, including the MI-17[^2].

## Financial Details

The Upper Arun Hydropower Project represents a significant financial investment. According to reports, it will be the most expensive hydroelectric project in Nepal with a price tag of \$1.6 billion[^7]. However, there appears to be some discrepancy in the reported costs, as one source mentions an estimated construction cost of Rs 2.26 billion[^3], which would be substantially lower.

The project is being developed through a "blended financing" model with 30% equity investment and 70% loans[^3]. The equity portion comes from multiple sources, including:

- Nepal Electricity Authority
- Federal government
- Provincial government
- Local government of the affected area
- Local people from the district
- Ordinary public[^3]

The loan portion is expected to come from donor agencies and Nepali banks and financial institutions[^3]. The World Bank was rumored to be the primary lender, but reports indicate it has developed "cold feet" about the project and refused to sign an agreement that had been slated for submission to its board of directors in June[^6][^7].

In terms of expenditure to date, the project has distributed compensation of Rs 1.45 billion to locals affected by the project, representing approximately 64% of the total planned compensation[^3]. The compensation rate has been fixed at Rs 1-1.5 million per ropani[^3]. Additionally, Nepal has reportedly spent over two and a half billion rupees on land acquisition, which is nearing completion[^6].

## Implementation Structure

The Upper Arun Hydropower Project is being implemented by Upper Arun Hydro Electric Limited (UAHEL), a subsidiary company of Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) established on 2073/10/12 according to the Nepali calendar[^1][^4]. This entity is fully owned by NEA, with a 100% stake[^4].

The leadership structure includes:

- Kulman Ghising: NEA Managing Director and Chairman of UAHEL[^2]
- Fanendra Raj Joshi: Managing Director of UAHEL[^2]

For the construction of the access road, contracts have been signed with:

- Gayatri JV (India)
- Kankai Surunga JV of Jhapa[^3]

In May, UAHEL signed up the French firm Tractebel for the detailed design of the scheme[^7]. The project appears to have established offices in different locations, with Grisma Bhandari mentioned as an official of the project[^3].

The implementation also involves significant human resources, including engineers, construction workers, and support staff who are working in challenging conditions in the remote areas of Sankhuwasabha district.

## Technical Specifications

The Upper Arun Hydropower Project incorporates several sophisticated technical elements designed to maximize power generation while navigating the challenging topography of the region.

Key technical specifications include:

- **Project Type**: Run-of-River with 6 hours peaking capacity[^1]
- **Gross Head**: 508.3 meters[^1][^4]
- **Design Discharge**: 235 cubic meters per second[^1]
- **Dam Height**: 100 meters[^1]
- **Headrace Tunnel**: 8.4 kilometers[^1]
- **Sediment Bypass Tunnel**: 1.4 kilometers[^1]
- **Surge Tank**: 20 meters in diameter[^1]
- **Pressure Drop Shaft**: 484 meters high and 7.3 meters in diameter[^1]
- **Penstock**: 39 meters long before bifurcation[^1] (note: one source mentions 60 meters total penstock length[^4])
- **Penstock Diameter**: 2.8 meters[^4]
- **Turbine Type**: 6 units of Pelton turbines[^1][^4]
- **Powerhouse Type**: Underground[^1]
- **Powerhouse Dimensions**: 230.05 m × 25.7 m × 59.43 m[^1]

The technical design will need to account for future climate-induced hazards such as glacial lake outbursts, similar to the one that swept away the 1,600 MW Chungthang Teesta III in Sikkim[^7]. This risk mitigation is particularly important given the project's location in a Himalayan region where climate change is affecting glacial dynamics.

## Socioeconomic Impact

The Upper Arun Hydropower Project is expected to have significant socioeconomic implications for both the local area and Nepal as a whole. While specific details about nationwide economic benefits are not extensively covered in the search results, several key impacts can be identified.

In terms of land acquisition, the project has acquired 2,500 ropanies (approximately 127 hectares) of land around Bhotkhola of Sankhuwasabha district[^3]. Another source mentions 4,563.06 ropanis (approximately 232.14 hectares) of private land acquired in Bhotkhola[^6]. The project has distributed compensation of Rs 1.45 billion to affected local people, with compensation rates fixed at Rs 1-1.5 million per ropani[^3].

Employment generation is significant, with the project expected to employ approximately 3,000 workers at peak construction[^8]. This influx of workers represents both an opportunity for local economic stimulus and a challenge for social integration.

The Cumulative Impact Assessment conducted for the project identifies several social impacts, including:

- Changes in settlement demographics patterns (High impact in Upper Arun River Basin)[^5]
- Impacts on sense of place (High impact in Upper Arun River Basin)[^5]
- Deterioration or loss of social safety nets (High impact in Upper Arun River Basin)[^5]
- Access to local power structures/social capital (High impact in Upper Arun River Basin)[^5]
- Generation of social tension (High impact in Upper Arun River Basin)[^5]

Additional social considerations mentioned include preserving Indigenous Peoples' way of life, health and safety impacts on the community (especially women's safety), increased demand on social infrastructure and emergency services, and generation of local income through the recruitment of workers from local communities[^8].

## Challenges and Controversies

The Upper Arun Hydropower Project faces numerous significant challenges and controversies that have impacted its implementation timeline and may affect its future development.

One major obstacle has been administrative delays. The project faced an 18-month delay due to prolonged approval processes for using national forest land and clearing trees[^2]. These bureaucratic hurdles reflect the complexity of developing large infrastructure projects in environmentally sensitive areas.

Political interference has emerged as a significant issue. Reports indicate that construction has "come to a standstill" due to interference from former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda', as well as concerns raised by neighboring India and international lenders[^6]. The former Prime Minister is accused of "leveraging economic diplomacy and neighborly relations for personal and party gain"[^6].

International relations play a crucial role in the project's challenges. While Beijing is said to have no objections to the project, "India's silence is said to stem from its strategic interest in not allowing anyone else to build large storage projects on the tributaries of the Ganga in Nepal"[^7]. This geopolitical dimension adds complexity to what would already be a challenging infrastructure project.

Financing has become another major hurdle. The World Bank, rumored to be the primary lender, has apparently developed "cold feet" about the project[^7]. At an investment conference, the Bank "refused to sign the agreement, halting the proposal for Upper Arun that had been slated for submission to the board of directors last June"[^6]. This development echoes the Bank's withdrawal from the Arun III project thirty years ago[^7].

Environmental concerns are also significant, including:

- Managing environmental flow of the Arun River to maintain aquatic habitat values and connectivity
- Forest clearance impacts
- Sediment transport issues
- Risks of landslides
- Impacts on springs used by villages
- Air quality impacts due to construction activities
- Biodiversity impacts including risks to critical flora and fauna habitats
- Potential impacts to the Makalu Barun National Park[^8]


## Historical Context

The development of the Upper Arun Hydropower Project exists within a broader historical context of hydropower development on the Arun River. Thirty years ago, around 1995, the World Bank abruptly pulled out of the Arun III project after opposition by civil society in Nepal, Japan, and Europe[^7]. Under the leadership of then-president James Wolfensohn, the Bank exited that project, which has since been developed by India's state-owned SJVN Limited with its generation capacity doubled to 900MW[^7].

This historical precedent is relevant because the World Bank appears to be repeating history by developing "cold feet" about the Upper Arun project. The circumstances are different, however. Whereas in 1995, the opposition to Arun III was mainly from activists, the current reluctance appears to be influenced by geopolitical considerations, particularly India's apparent displeasure with the Bank's involvement[^7].

The project exists within a complex regional dynamic where India's SJVN is currently constructing three large projects downstream, including Arun III and Lower Arun, with a total generation capacity of nearly 2,000MW[^7]. This indicates a strategic interest from India in controlling hydropower development on this river system.

The designation of the project as a "Game Changer Project" by the Government of Nepal underscores its perceived importance in the national energy strategy, highlighting its relatively low cost of generation and availability of abundant firm energy[^1].

## Future Outlook

Despite the current challenges, the Upper Arun Hydropower Project remains a key component of Nepal's energy development strategy. When completed, it will be Nepal's most expensive hydroelectric project to date and potentially one of its most productive.

According to current projections, the project is expected to be commissioned in 2028[^4], though some sources suggest power generation might begin from 2030[^3]. This timeline assumes that the current obstacles, including political interference and funding challenges, can be resolved.

The future design and implementation of the project will need to incorporate climate resilience measures. Specifically, experts say the design will have to take into account future climate-induced glacial lake outbursts like the one that swept away the 1,600MW Chungthang Teesta III in Sikkim last year[^7]. This adaptation to climate risk will be critical for the long-term sustainability of the project.

The successful completion of the Upper Arun Hydropower Project would represent a significant step forward in Nepal's ambitions to harness its vast hydropower potential. With an expected annual energy generation of 4,512 GWh, the project could substantially contribute to meeting domestic energy needs and potentially position Nepal as an energy exporter in the region.

However, the path forward remains uncertain. The project will need to overcome substantial challenges related to financing, political interference, environmental concerns, and regional geopolitics. The resolution of these issues will determine whether this "Game Changer Project" lives up to its promise.

## Conclusion

The Upper Arun Hydropower Project embodies both the enormous potential and the significant challenges of large-scale hydropower development in Nepal. With a planned capacity of 1,061 MW and an estimated cost of \$1.6 billion, it represents one of the most ambitious energy infrastructure projects in the country's history.

The project has made tangible progress, particularly in land acquisition and the construction of access infrastructure. However, it faces substantial obstacles including political interference, international financing challenges, and complex geopolitical considerations involving India and China.

If successfully implemented, the Upper Arun Hydropower Project could transform Nepal's energy landscape and contribute significantly to the country's economic development. However, the path forward will require resolving multiple technical, financial, political, and environmental challenges. The project's ultimate success will depend on effective coordination between domestic stakeholders and international partners, as well as the resolution of regional geopolitical considerations that currently appear to be impeding progress.
