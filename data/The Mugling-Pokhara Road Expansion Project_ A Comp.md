# The Mugling-Pokhara Road Expansion Project: A Comprehensive Analysis

The Mugling-Pokhara Road Expansion Project represents one of Nepal's significant infrastructure developments aimed at enhancing connectivity to the country's tourism capital, Pokhara. Despite facing numerous challenges including pandemic-related delays and construction difficulties, the project continues to progress with varying degrees of success across its different sections. This expansion is expected to substantially improve travel conditions, boost tourism, and contribute to regional economic development once completed.

## Project Overview and Classification

The Mugling-Pokhara Road Expansion Project is officially known as the "South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Mugling-Pokhara Highway Improvement Phase 1 Project" (SMPHIP)[^2]. It is sometimes simply referred to as the Prithvi Highway Expansion, as it covers a critical section of the Prithvi Highway, one of Nepal's strategic road networks[^6][^9]. The project involves upgrading and rehabilitating 81 kilometers of highway from a two-lane road to a four-lane road with asphalt surfacing[^2][^15]. This infrastructure initiative falls under the broader SASEC program, reflecting its importance not just nationally but also for regional connectivity and economic integration.

The project is designed to improve domestic connectivity between Gandaki Pradesh (Province No. 4) and the Central Capital Kathmandu, serving as a vital link for tourism, trade, and everyday transportation[^2]. While not explicitly mentioned as a National Pride Project in the available information, its strategic importance for Nepal's tourism industry and regional connectivity suggests high national significance.

## Geographical Coverage and Route Details

The Mugling-Pokhara Road Expansion covers two key districts—Tanahun and Kaski—within the Gandaki Pradesh[^1][^2]. This strategic highway section begins at Khahare Khola near the municipal office of Abukhaireni municipality and terminates at the Seti Bridge in Pokhara Metropolitan City[^2]. More specifically, the project upgrades the section from kilometer 8+250 at Milan Chowk of the Abukhaireni Municipality to the Seti Bridge in Pokhara[^2].

For implementation purposes, the project has been divided into two distinct sections:

1. **Eastern Section**: Spans approximately 41.45-43 kilometers from Abukhaireni to Jamune in Tanahun district[^2][^4][^15].
2. **Western Section**: Extends 38.88-39 kilometers from Jamune in Tanahun to Setipul/Seti Bridge in Pokhara, Kaski district[^1][^3][^6].

This 81-kilometer stretch serves as the main route linking the tourist capital of Pokhara with other major transportation hubs, including connections to Kathmandu via Mugling[^1]. The existing width of the road was 8.0 meters prior to the expansion work[^2].

## Project Timeline and Current Status

### Planning and Implementation Timeline

The conception and initial planning dates of the project are not explicitly mentioned in the available information. However, the implementation timeline shows:

- **Eastern Section**: Contract awarded in April 2021 with construction commencing in mid-April 2021[^4][^12][^14].
- **Western Section**: Contract signed on May 16, 2021, with work beginning on August 28, 2021[^1][^9][^15].

The original timelines set for completion were:

- Eastern Section: April 2024 (three-year contract period)[^14]
- Western Section: August 28, 2024 (three-year contract period)[^9][^15]


### Revised Deadlines

Both sections have experienced significant delays, necessitating deadline extensions:

- **Eastern Section**: A six-month extension was requested due to COVID-19 pandemic disruptions, potentially pushing completion to October 2024[^8][^14].
- **Western Section**: Has received two deadline extensions. After the original three-year contract period ended in August 2024, it was initially extended by 101 days (to December 5, 2024), and subsequently extended again to December 31, 2025[^3][^6][^9][^10][^11].


### Current Progress Status

As of the most recent reports, the physical progress of the project varies between the two sections:

- **Eastern Section**: Achieved approximately 55-56% physical progress as of April 2024[^8][^14]. This includes blacktopping 28 km in one direction and 15 km in both directions in areas including Abu Khaireni, Bandipur, Byas, and Myagdi[^8].
- **Western Section**: Progress has been significantly slower, starting at merely 4% in February 2023[^12], increasing to 19-20% by April 2024[^8][^14], reaching 30% by September 2024[^16], and most recently reported at 34.94-35% in December 2024[^3][^6][^9][^10]. Out of the total stretch, 23.91 km has been blacktopped, including 5.45 km of two-way and 18.46 km of one-way roads[^6][^10].


## Financial Aspects and Funding Structure

### Budget Allocation

The total project cost is reported to be approximately \$195 million[^7]. Breaking this down by sections:

- **Western Section**: Budgeted at Rs 7.40 billion (approximately \$61.8 million at 2021 exchange rates)[^3][^6][^10][^15]
- **Eastern Section**: Allocated Rs 6.21 billion (approximately \$51.8 million at 2021 exchange rates)[^8][^14]


### Funding Sources

The primary funding for this project comes from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which is providing concessional loan assistance[^2][^15][^16]. The project aligns with objectives set out in the country partnership strategy and is included in ADB's country operations business plan[^2].

No specific information on cost overruns is provided in the available sources, though the multiple deadline extensions suggest potential budget implications. Similarly, detailed financial progress as a percentage is not explicitly mentioned in the sources.

## Implementation Structure and Key Stakeholders

### Government Agencies

The project is being implemented by the Department of Roads (DOR), Project Directorate (ADB), under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure \& Transport (MoPIT) of the Government of Nepal[^2]. The project has established offices in different locations to oversee the two sections – one in Pokhara for the western section and another in Gunadi for the eastern section[^15].

### Contractors and Construction Companies

The project has engaged different contractors for its two sections:

- **Eastern Section**: China Communication Construction Company (CCCC) was awarded the contract[^7][^8][^14].
- **Western Section**: Initially reported as Sinohydro Corporation[^7], but most sources consistently mention Anhui Kaiyuan Highway and Bridge Co Ltd (also called Yanhui Kaiyuan Highway and Bridge Construction) as the primary contractor[^1][^3][^6][^10][^15].

The implementation involves significant human resources, with the western section alone reportedly employing 60 Nepali engineers, 50 Chinese engineers, and more than 400 other workers to expedite construction[^4][^15].

## Technical Specifications and Design Features

### Road Design Standards

The project is upgrading the existing two-lane road with an 8-meter width to a four-lane highway with asphalt surfacing[^2][^15]. The width of the expanded road varies depending on the location:

- At Dulegaunda bazaar and main market areas: 46 meters[^4][^15]
- From Jamune to Kumlekhola section: 18 meters[^4][^15]
- Other sections: 23 meters[^4][^15]

The Right of Way (ROW) for the project is 50 meters, although utilization has been minimized and resettlement impacts limited to the corridor of impact (COI), which is 46 meters in built-up sections and 30 meters in rural areas[^2].

### Key Engineering Components

The project involves comprehensive infrastructure development beyond just road widening:

- Construction of bridges: The western section alone requires building 11-13 bridges (sources vary slightly), with 5 completed and 5 others reportedly in the final stages of construction[^6][^9][^10].
- Other infrastructure: Includes culverts and drainage systems[^1][^9].
- Road surface: Includes blacktopping with asphalt.

The construction work has been sequenced strategically, with priority given to culvert and drain construction before the onset of rainy seasons to mitigate potential damage[^8]. Additionally, blacktopping is postponed in areas prone to landslides, particularly beyond 500 meters from identified landslide sites[^8].

## Socioeconomic Impact Assessment

### Expected Benefits

The Mugling-Pokhara Road Expansion Project is expected to deliver significant socioeconomic benefits once completed:

- **Poverty Reduction**: Contributing to economic development of rural communities along the route[^2].
- **Improved Connectivity**: Enhancing accessibility to markets, district headquarters, and other centers of economic activity[^2].
- **Time Savings**: Reducing travel time by approximately 20% (about 30 minutes)[^2].
- **Economic Development**: Increasing income-generating activities through the development of market centers and tourist hubs[^2].
- **Trade Facilitation**: Providing easier transport for export and import of goods to and from the project road districts[^2].
- **Asset Appreciation**: Increasing land prices along the road alignment[^2].
- **Infrastructure Development**: Catalyzing development of other infrastructure and economic diversification activities[^2].


### Impact on Local Communities

While the long-term benefits are promising, the current construction phase has created significant challenges for local communities:

- **Business Disruption**: Local businesses along the route have reported up to a 75% drop in trade compared to pre-construction periods, with some shops closing completely[^16].
- **Regional Impact**: Overall business in Tanahun district has reportedly suffered more than a 25% decline due to the expansion work[^16].
- **Transportation Hardships**: Travel time has increased substantially during construction, from previously 3 hours to now 5-6 hours between Pokhara and Mugling[^12][^16].
- **Tourism Decline**: Decreased visitors to Pokhara due to difficult travel conditions, affecting the region's primary economic sector[^12].


### Land Acquisition and Resettlement

The project has made efforts to minimize involuntary resettlement impacts by adopting a technical design that uses available space owned by the Department of Roads to the extent possible[^2]. Compensation for affected structures and assistance to non-title holders have been part of the project's social safeguards implementation[^2].

## Challenges and Implementation Obstacles

### Major Delays and Causal Factors

The project has faced numerous challenges leading to significant delays:

- **COVID-19 Pandemic**: Disrupted work schedules and material supply chains[^7][^14][^16].
- **Geographical Challenges**: Difficult terrain making construction technically challenging[^7].
- **Coordination Issues**: Lack of effective coordination between government authorities and contractors[^7].
- **Administrative Delays**: Late issuance of tree-cutting orders and delays in initiating construction[^9].
- **Infrastructure Relocation**: Challenges in relocating electric transmission lines and managing water pipelines[^9].
- **Urban Area Complications**: Difficulties in managing existing structures, electric poles, and water infrastructure within the road's right-of-way, especially in built-up areas[^1].


### Impact on Transportation and Tourism

The ongoing construction has severely affected transportation efficiency and tourism:

- **Extended Travel Times**: What was previously a 3-hour journey from Pokhara to Mugling now takes over 5 hours[^16].
- **Vehicle Damage**: Potholes and rough road conditions causing frequent vehicle breakdowns[^16][^17].
- **Tourism Accessibility**: Poor road access affecting visitors to Pokhara International Airport and the city's tourism industry[^17].
- **Public Complaints**: Increasing dissatisfaction due to the prolonged construction period and travel difficulties[^1].


## Historical Context and Project Development

Mugling-Pokhara road forms part of the Prithvi Highway, one of Nepal's strategic road networks and a critical section for the country's tourism industry[^2]. The road connects Pokhara, which serves as the tourism capital of Nepal, to other major transportation hubs.

Historically, Mugling was a fishing village located at the confluence of Marshyangdi River and Trishuli River that transformed dramatically after highway connections were established in the 1970s[^5]. It now serves as an important interchange between two major highways: Prithvi Highway and Madan Ashrit Highway (also known as Mugling-Narayanghat Highway)[^5].

The expansion project was conceived as part of Nepal's broader strategy to develop domestic connectivity between touristic provincial capitals and the central capital, Kathmandu[^2]. This initiative is consistent with the objectives set out in the country partnership strategy with ADB[^2].

## Future Prospects and Development Outlook

### Remaining Work and Completion Perspectives

As of the latest reports, substantial work remains to complete both sections of the project:

- The eastern section has achieved around 55-56% physical progress[^8][^14].
- The western section lags behind at approximately 35% completion[^3][^6][^9][^10].

Both construction companies have pledged to complete their respective sections within the revised deadlines, with the eastern section potentially finishing in late 2024 and the western section by December 2025[^3][^6][^10].

### Expected Long-term Impact

Once completed, the expanded highway is expected to significantly enhance connectivity to Gandaki Pradesh and boost Nepal's tourism industry[^2]. The four-lane highway will provide safer, faster transportation between Pokhara and other parts of the country, supporting economic growth and regional development.

The project aligns with Nepal's broader infrastructure development strategy, focusing on improving domestic connectivity, reducing regional imbalances, and supporting key economic sectors such as tourism and trade[^2]. The successful completion of this project may set precedents for similar infrastructure upgrades throughout Nepal's strategic road network.

## Conclusion

The Mugling-Pokhara Road Expansion Project represents a significant infrastructure investment with the potential to transform connectivity and economic development in central Nepal. Despite numerous challenges and delays that have extended its timeline considerably, the project continues to advance, albeit at varying paces across its two sections.

The eastern section has made relatively good progress, reaching over 50% completion, while the western section has faced more significant obstacles, resulting in multiple deadline extensions. Once completed, this expanded highway promises substantial benefits for local communities, the tourism industry, and regional economic integration. However, the extended construction period continues to cause hardships for travelers and businesses along the route, highlighting the importance of efficient project management and mitigation strategies during large-scale infrastructure development.
