# Economic Implications of the Manakamana Cable Car: A Mixed Impact on Local Communities

The Manakamana Cable Car, inaugurated in November 1998 as Nepal's first commercial cable car service, has had profound and complex economic implications for both the temple area and the downward villages along the traditional trekking route. This analysis examines how this transportation innovation has created winners and losers within the local economy.

## Transformation of the Tourism Pattern

The cable car fundamentally altered the tourism pattern to Manakamana Temple by reducing a five-hour uphill climb to just a 10-minute ride[^6]. This dramatic change in accessibility has had several cascading effects:

- Travel time reduction allowed visitors from Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Chitwan to complete their pilgrimage in a single day instead of 2-3 days[^1]
- Passenger numbers grew from 200,000-300,000 annually in early years to 1,100,000 passengers annually by 2024[^5]
- The cable car has served over 17 million passengers during its 24 years of operation[^8]


## Positive Economic Impacts

### Growth Around Cable Car Stations

The area surrounding the cable car stations has experienced substantial economic benefits:

1. **Income Growth for Local Businesses:**
    - 40% of surveyed respondents reported a 50% increase in their income due to tourism activity and the Cable Car
    - Another 40% reported a 25% increase in income
    - 10% reported at least a 10% income increase[^1]
2. **New Business Opportunities:**
    - Selling arts and photos to visitors became a significant income source (40% of entrepreneurs)
    - Vegetable sales accounted for income increases of approximately 30%[^1]
    - Many new hotels have emerged in Kurintar
    - Numerous restaurants and coffee shops have opened along the highway connecting to the cable car[^2]
3. **Regional Development:**
    - The cable car has developed the region as a new tourism destination
    - The tourism hub now covers areas in Malekhu (Dhading district), Chitwan, and Gorkha district[^2]
    - Approximately 60% of employees in tourism businesses were generated locally[^1]
4. **Municipal Benefits:**
    - The Manakamana Cable Car provides Rs. 0.5 million annually to the local VDC (Village Development Committee)
    - It has contributed to local infrastructure maintenance, including trekking routes
    - The company has provided funds to local schools and supported forest conservation efforts[^1]

## Negative Economic Impacts

### Decline of Traditional Route-Based Businesses

The development of the cable car has severely affected communities and businesses along the traditional trekking route:

1. **Traditional Business Displacement:**
    - The cable car "directly hit the traditional business like horse riding business, moles, donkeys, used as porter activities"[^1][^4]
    - "The job of the porters is in danger and their living has been affected badly"[^1]
2. **Collapse of Trekking Route Economy:**
    - "After the construction of MCC, all the tourism and pilgrimage activities of old trekking route collapsed and the place became deserted"
    - "All the livelihood strategies of local people was destroyed and damaged"[^1]
3. **Socioeconomic Challenges:**
    - Increased crowd and social problems like theft have emerged
    - Solid waste disposal and drainage system management issues have developed
    - Noise pollution has increased in previously quiet areas[^1]

## Case Comparison: Annapurna Circuit

While not directly related to Manakamana, the experience of the Annapurna Circuit provides a parallel example of how reduced trekking time can impact local economies:

- The Annapurna trek was reduced from a 23-day journey to just 3 days due to road construction
- This reduction potentially cost local communities billions in lost revenue as tourists no longer needed to stay in villages along the route
- Many previously thriving villages saw dramatic declines in tourism business[^9]


## Economic Redistribution Pattern

The economic impact of the Manakamana Cable Car demonstrates a clear pattern of redistribution rather than uniform benefit:

1. **Winners:**
    - Businesses at the cable car's base station in Kurintar
    - Enterprises at the top near Manakamana Temple
    - The cable car company itself, which has grown substantially
    - Local areas receiving corporate social responsibility funds
2. **Losers:**
    - Traditional businesses along the former trekking route
    - Porter services, horse/mule operators, and small teahouses
    - Villages that previously served as overnight stops for pilgrims

## Conclusion

The Manakamana Cable Car presents a complex case study in tourism development economics. While it has undeniably stimulated economic growth around the cable car stations and increased overall visitor numbers to the temple, it has simultaneously disrupted traditional economic patterns and livelihoods along the former trekking route.

This pattern mirrors broader development trends where transportation innovations create concentrated economic benefits while potentially harming more geographically dispersed stakeholders who relied on the previous, slower transportation systems. For future infrastructure projects, policymakers might consider complementary development programs that help traditional service providers adapt to new tourism patterns rather than becoming economically displaced by them.
