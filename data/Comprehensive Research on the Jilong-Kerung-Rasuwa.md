# Comprehensive Research on the Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime Transmission Line Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The official name of this infrastructure project is the Jilong/Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220kV Cross-Border Power Transmission Line. This is an energy infrastructure project classified as a cross-border power transmission line. While the search results don't mention a specific project ID designation in Nepal's national planning system, the project's significance is evident as it represents the first-ever cross-border power transmission line between Nepal and China[^1][^4]. Although not explicitly stated as a "National Pride Project," its strategic importance for Nepal's energy sector and international relations is clear.

## Geographical Coverage

The Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime Transmission Line will connect Nepal and China through the northern border. The project covers Rasuwa district in Nepal, specifically starting from Chilime, a small village close to the Chinese border, and extending to Jilong/Kerung in China through the Rasuwagadhi border point[^5]. According to available information, the Nepal section of the transmission line is approximately 16 kilometers in length, while the nearest substation on the Chinese side is approximately 80 kilometers from the border[^4].

The project will connect to the recently completed Chilime-Trishuli transmission line, which links Chilime in Rasuwa district to Trishuli in Nuwakot district[^5].

## Timeline and Status

The development timeline of the Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime Transmission Line includes several key milestones:

- A significant breakthrough occurred in September 2023 during Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal's visit to China, when the two countries signed an agreement that China would provide grants to construct the cross-border power line[^1]
- The joint statement issued during this visit stated: "The two sides will launch the construction of the Jilong/Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220kV Cross-Border Power Transmission line at an early date"[^1][^4]
- As of December 2023, Nepal and China were set to discuss the implementation modality of the project[^1]

Currently, the project appears to be in the planning and preparation phase. According to senior officials from the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), a fresh Detailed Project Report (DPR) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) need to be conducted, which may take approximately 3-4 years[^4]. This suggests that construction has not yet begun.

A critical prerequisite to this project, the 28km Chilime-Trishuli 220kV transmission line, was completed in November 2024 after seven years of construction[^3][^5], which will eventually connect to this cross-border transmission line.

## Financial Details

The financial structure of the Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime Transmission Line project is still being determined. During Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal's visit to China in September 2023, the two countries signed an agreement that "China would provide grants to construct the cross-border power line"[^1]. However, as of late 2023, there was still "no clarity on how it will be built and what would be the funding modality" according to Dirghayu Kumar Shrestha, chief of transmission directorate at the Nepal Electricity Authority[^4].

While specific budget figures for this project are not mentioned in the search results, it's worth noting that the related Chilime-Trishuli transmission line project (which will connect to this cross-border line) cost approximately 65 million euros (approximately Rs 9.49 billion as of November 2024)[^5].

## Implementation Structure

The implementation structure for the Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime Transmission Line was still being determined as of late 2023. The Nepal Electricity Authority would likely be the primary implementing agency on the Nepal side, while the State Grid Corporation of China would likely be involved on the Chinese side, as these entities were mentioned as participating in the Joint Working Group discussions regarding the project[^4].

In December 2023, the two countries were set to "discuss the implementation modality" and "fix a joint mechanism meeting"[^1], indicating that specific details about contractors, sub-contractors, and the project management structure were still being negotiated.

## Technical Specifications

The Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime Transmission Line will be constructed as a 220kV transmission line[^1][^4][^5]. This represents a downgrade from Nepal's initial proposal of a 400kV Ratmate-Rasuwagadhi-Kerung Cross-Border Transmission Line, which would have had a capacity to carry 5,000MW of power[^4].

The reduction to 220kV was requested by the Chinese side during a meeting of the Joint Working Group in February (year not specified) to expedite the project's development[^4]. However, recognizing the need for potential future expansion, "there has been discussion on constructing multi-circuit transmission pylons along the alignment of the 220KV line so that the same pylons can be used to upgrade the capacity of the transmission line in the future"[^4].

On the Nepal side, a 220kV substation is being built at Chilime Hub, approximately 16km inward from the border point, while China is distributing power in its bordering areas with a 220kV line[^4].

## Socioeconomic Impact

The Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime Transmission Line is expected to deliver significant socioeconomic benefits to Nepal:

- It will facilitate electricity trade between Nepal and China, opening a new market for Nepal's growing hydropower generation capacity[^1][^5]
- The cross-border power line is considered "vital in attracting Chinese investments to Nepal's hydropower sector with the aim of selling power to China"[^4]
- It provides an alternative market for Nepali electricity, particularly important given that "because of some new conditions imposed by India, Nepal cannot export power from hydropower projects with Chinese elements, such as investors or contractors"[^4]

This project represents a strategic opportunity for Nepal to diversify its energy trade partners beyond India, potentially strengthening its position in regional energy diplomacy.

## Challenges and Controversies

The development of the Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime Transmission Line faces several challenges:

- Lengthy timeline: According to NEA officials, a fresh Detailed Project Report and Environmental Impact Assessment will need to be conducted, potentially taking 3-4 years[^4]
- Implementation uncertainty: As of December 2023, there was still "no clarity on how it will be built and what would be the funding modality"[^4]
- Technical capacity compromise: The reduction from Nepal's proposed 400kV line (capable of carrying 5,000MW) to a 220kV line represents a significant downgrade in capacity, though there are plans for future upgrades[^4]
- Geographical challenges: The transmission line must traverse difficult mountainous terrain, as evidenced by the challenges faced in constructing the connecting Chilime-Trishuli line, where "erecting a pylon was challenging in many areas" due to lack of roads, vulnerability to floods and landslides, and high elevation (up to 2,600 meters above sea level)[^5]


## Historical Context

The Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime Transmission Line represents a significant milestone in Nepal-China energy cooperation. It will be "the first-ever cross-border power line between the two neighbours even though Nepal has a dozen of such power lines with its southern neighbour—India"[^1][^4].

The project has evolved from Nepal's initial proposal for a 400kV Ratmate-Rasuwagadhi-Kerung Cross-Border Transmission Line. During a meeting of the Joint Working Group comprising representatives of the NEA and the State Grid Corporation of China, the Chinese side called for reducing the capacity to 220kV to expedite development[^4].

The recently completed Chilime-Trishuli transmission line (November 2024), which took seven years to build, will serve as a crucial connecting infrastructure for this cross-border project[^3][^5].

## Future Outlook

The Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime Transmission Line represents a strategic infrastructure development with significant implications for Nepal's energy sector:

- It will enable Nepal to trade electricity with China, opening new market opportunities for Nepal's growing hydropower generation[^1][^4][^5]
- The project design incorporates potential for future capacity upgrades through multi-circuit transmission pylons[^4]
- It will connect with the recently completed Chilime-Trishuli transmission line, which will "serve as a link to China"[^5]
- In the longer term, Nepal may still pursue its original vision of a 400kV transmission line designed to carry up to 5,000MW, as mentioned in the NEA's annual report 2021-22[^4]

Despite the challenges and lengthy timeline, this cross-border transmission line project represents a significant step in Nepal's efforts to diversify its energy trade partnerships and strengthen regional connectivity, potentially transforming Nepal's position in the regional energy landscape.
