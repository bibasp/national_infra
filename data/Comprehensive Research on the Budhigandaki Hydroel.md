# Comprehensive Research on the Budhigandaki Hydroelectric Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The infrastructure project is officially named the Budhigandaki Hydroelectric Project, sometimes also spelled as Budhi Gandaki Hydroelectric Project. This is a storage hydropower plant infrastructure project, classified as a hydroelectric power generation facility. While the search results don't explicitly mention a specific project ID designation in national planning, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has clearly designated it as a National Pride Project, highlighting its strategic importance to Nepal's development agenda[^2].

## Geographical Coverage

The Budhigandaki Hydroelectric Project is located on the Budhi Gandaki River, approximately 2 kilometers upstream of its confluence with the Trishuli River. The site is positioned about 55 kilometers west of Kathmandu (approximately 80 kilometers by road)[^1]. The project area spans the Gorkha district, though specific province details aren't mentioned in the search results.

In terms of capacity, the project is designed with an installed capacity of 1,200 megawatts (MW), making it the largest hydropower project in Nepal, exceeding both the 900 MW Upper Karnali and Arun III projects[^1]. This substantial capacity underscores its national significance in Nepal's energy infrastructure development.

## Timeline and Status

The Budhigandaki Hydroelectric Project has a lengthy development timeline:

- Initial identification: The site was first identified in the late 1970s, specifically in 1978[^1][^4]
- Early studies: A pre-feasibility study was conducted in 1984, followed by the first feasibility study in 1998[^1][^4]
- Further assessment: Additional optimization studies were carried out by the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) in 2010-2011[^1]

As of July 2023, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal announced that the project would begin soon, stating: "Foundation stone will be laid to the project within few days. There won't be any delay on its construction"[^2].

More recently, in March 2024, a committee formed by the energy ministry recommended that the government start project implementation in 2024/25 and complete it by 2031/32, providing a clear timeline for the project's execution[^4].

Based on the most recent information available, the project appears to be in the advanced planning stage, with implementation expected to begin soon.

## Financial Details

The financial structure of the Budhigandaki Hydroelectric Project is substantial:

- As of July 2023, approximately Rs 43 billion had already been distributed as compensation to those whose lands were acquired for the project (Rs 34 billion for houses and over Rs 6 billion for plants)[^2]
- A committee led by Joint Secretary Nabin Raj Singh of the energy ministry has proposed a financing structure that includes government ownership of 51% stakes in the project company[^4]
- The proposed annual funding requirements are: Rs 17.37 billion in the first year, Rs 19.01 billion in the second year, Rs 23.81 billion in the third year, Rs 41.67 billion in the fourth year, Rs 44.95 billion in the fifth year, Rs 82.49 billion in the sixth year, Rs 2.43 billion in the seventh year, and Rs 38.74 billion in the final year[^4]

The committee has suggested forming a consortium of co-financiers, including the Employee Provident Fund, Citizen Investment Trust, HIDCL (Hydroelectricity Investment and Development Company Limited), Social Security Fund, and commercial banks to arrange the necessary commercial loans[^4].

Previous funding efforts included an infrastructure tax on petroleum product imports, which was collecting approximately Rs 1 billion per month as of November 2019[^1].

## Implementation Structure

The implementation of the Budhigandaki Hydroelectric Project involves several key stakeholders:

- Developer: Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) is designated to develop the project[^1]
- Operating company: Budhigandaki Hydroelectric Company Limited, with Dr. Jagat Kumar Shrestha serving as CEO[^2][^4]
- Government oversight: Ministry of Energy, Water Resources, and Irrigation has finalized the project's investment modality[^4]

A committee formed by the energy ministry, led by Joint Secretary Nabin Raj Singh and including HIDCL CEO Arjun Kumar Gautam, Budhigandaki Hydroelectric Company Limited CEO Dr. Jagat Kumar Shrestha, and Senior Divisional Engineer Raju Maharjan, has proposed the implementation modality[^4].

## Technical Specifications

The Budhigandaki Hydroelectric Project features significant technical specifications:

- Dam height: The project will involve constructing a 263-meter high dam in the Budhigandaki River, located approximately two kilometers west from the Prithvi Highway at Malekhu[^2]
- Reservoir size: The project will create a pond 16 times larger than Fewa Lake[^2]
- Project type: Storage hydropower plant (not run-of-river), allowing for controlled electricity generation[^1]

The project's 1,200 MW capacity makes it the largest hydropower project in Nepal, significantly enhancing the country's electricity generation capacity[^1].

## Socioeconomic Impact

The Budhigandaki Hydroelectric Project is expected to deliver numerous socioeconomic benefits:

- Prime Minister Dahal described the project as having "multi-dimensional impacts" that would benefit the larger public and contribute to the national economy[^2]
- The project will provide multiple benefits beyond electricity generation, including irrigation, drinking water, fisheries, water transportation, flood control, and tourism development[^4]
- A 225-kilometer long ring road will be built around the future reservoir, which is expected to serve as a tourist attraction[^1]
- The project will create various employment opportunities for locals, as noted by CEO Jagat Shrestha, who mentioned "development of fisheries and eco-tourism as well as different sorts of employment for the locals"[^2]
- The electricity generated from the project is expected to positively impact Nepal's economy by reducing the billions of rupees spent annually on importing petroleum products[^4]

Land acquisition and compensation has been a major component of the project, with Rs 43 billion already distributed as compensation to affected landowners[^2].

## Challenges and Controversies

The Budhigandaki Hydroelectric Project has faced several significant challenges:

- Political uncertainty: The Annapurna Express described the project as "unable to rise above political intrigues" with years spent debating whether to construct it with domestic or foreign investment[^4]
- High cost concerns: As of June 2019, the Finance Ministry had raised concerns about the total cost of the project[^1]
- Project prioritization issues: In June 2019, the 635 MW Dudh Koshi Hydroelectric Project was temporarily favored by NEA over the Budhigandaki project due to its lower social impact ("only" 162 households severely impacted), lower cost (\$1.5 billion), and more steady power output[^1]
- Population relocation: Uncertainty related to population relocation has been a significant challenge for the project[^1]

These issues contributed to delays in the project's implementation over several years.

## Historical Context

The Budhigandaki Hydroelectric Project has a lengthy historical context:

- The project site was first identified in the late 1970s (specifically 1978)[^1][^4]
- A pre-feasibility study was conducted in 1984, followed by the first feasibility study in 1998[^1]
- Additional studies were conducted by NEA in 2010-2011 to optimize the hydropower potential of the site[^1]
- By November 2019, approximately Rs 37 billion (\$300 million) had been raised for the project, primarily through an infrastructure tax on petroleum products imports[^1]
- The compensation process for affected landowners was targeted to be completed by mid-July 2020[^1]

The project has seen periods of both prioritization and de-prioritization, with a June 2019 assessment temporarily favoring the Dudh Koshi Hydroelectric Project due to perceived advantages in cost and social impact[^1].

## Future Outlook

Based on the most recent information available, the Budhigandaki Hydroelectric Project is poised for implementation:

- Timeline: The recommended implementation period is from 2024/25 to 2031/32[^4]
- Financial structure: The government is expected to own 51% stakes in the project company, with a consortium of domestic financial institutions providing funding[^4]
- Development benefits: The project is expected to provide multiple benefits beyond electricity generation, including irrigation, drinking water, fisheries, water transportation, flood control, and tourism development[^4]
- Economic impact: The electricity generated is expected to reduce Nepal's dependence on imported petroleum products, positively impacting the national economy[^4]

Prime Minister Dahal has expressed strong commitment to the project, stating: "We're resolved to move ahead the project now... This is a 'ready to go' project. We are preparing to take forward the project as early as possible. We can't afford to dillydally the work in any pretext"[^2].

The project represents a strategic opportunity for Nepal to utilize domestic capital for infrastructure development while addressing multiple development priorities through a single large-scale investment.
