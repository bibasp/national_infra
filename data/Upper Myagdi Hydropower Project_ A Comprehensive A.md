These landslides have affected at least seven hydropower projects in Myagdi district, including the Upper Myagdi project[^10][^12].

The disruptions have impeded the transport of crucial supplies including diesel, steel rods, cement, and explosive materials needed for tunnel construction[^6]. This highlights the vulnerability of infrastructure projects in Nepal's mountainous regions to natural disasters and the challenges of maintaining reliable supply chains in such environments.

### Community Relations:

While not directly linked to this specific project, there are indications of broader tensions between hydropower developers and local communities in the region. Reports mention that locals in Raghuganga Rural Municipality have presented a 31-point demand to hydropower projects in their area, citing concerns about unfulfilled social responsibilities and environmental impacts[^14].

The community concerns include issues related to environmental pollution and demands for road improvements, suggesting that local residents are actively seeking to ensure that hydropower development provides tangible benefits to affected communities while minimizing negative impacts[^14].

The search results do not provide specific information about mitigation strategies employed by the Upper Myagdi project to address these challenges, though the coordinated approach to access road development with other hydropower projects in the area suggests some level of collaborative problem-solving.

## Historical Context

The Upper Myagdi Hydropower Project has undergone some evolution during its development phase, reflecting the dynamic nature of energy infrastructure planning in Nepal's evolving hydropower sector.

According to project documentation, the Upper Myagdi Hydroelectric Project was initially conceptualized with a capacity of 20 MW, but was later revised upward to 37 MW[^16]. This significant increase in generating capacity (85%) likely reflects revised hydrological assessments, technological improvements, or changes in economic feasibility calculations during the project planning phase.

The project is part of a broader development trend in the Myagdi district, where approximately 13 large and small hydropower projects with a combined capacity of about 238 megawatts have initiated construction[^15]. This concentration of development has been made possible by recent improvements in road infrastructure and the Nepal Electricity Authority's construction of transmission lines and substations in the area.

The search results do not provide information about previous attempts at developing this specific project or detailed political context surrounding its approval and implementation. However, the clustering of multiple hydropower projects in this region suggests a coordinated push to develop Nepal's hydropower resources in geographically advantageous locations, likely supported by national energy policies prioritizing domestic generation capacity.

## Future Outlook

As the Upper Myagdi Hydropower Project progresses toward its scheduled completion in mid-April 2026, it represents an important contribution to Nepal's expanding renewable energy portfolio.

### Remaining Work:

Based on the project's commencement in February 2024 and the available progress reports, significant construction work remains to be completed, including:

- Completion of the 4-kilometer tunnel connecting Simkosh Dobhan dam to Ghimleti
- Construction of the dam and intake structures
- Installation of electromechanical equipment
- Completion of the powerhouse
- Connection to the transmission infrastructure


### Connected Infrastructure:

The project's future operation is closely tied to the completion of associated transmission infrastructure. The Nepal Electricity Authority is constructing a 132 kV capacity substation in Malika Rural Municipality-7, Dadakhet, which will connect the generated electricity to the central grid through a 9.2-kilometer transmission line from the power plant[^5][^7]. The timely completion of this substation is critical for the project to begin supplying power to the national grid once generation commences.

### Regional Development Context:

The Upper Myagdi Hydropower Project is part of a significant cluster of hydropower development in the Myagdi district. According to the Department of Electricity Development, three hydropower projects with a total capacity of 49 megawatts have already come into operation in the district, and 17 others with a total capacity of 700.83 megawatts have obtained licenses for construction[^10][^12].

This concentration of hydropower development reflects a strategic focus on areas with favorable hydrological conditions and the gradual improvement of infrastructure necessary to support construction and operation. The collective impact of these projects is expected to significantly boost Nepal's domestic electricity generation capacity, potentially transforming the country from an energy importer to an exporter in the coming decades.

The search results do not provide specific information about maintenance plans for the Upper Myagdi project once operational, though standard industry practices would involve regular maintenance schedules for civil structures, electromechanical equipment, and transmission components.

## Conclusion

The Upper Myagdi Hydropower Project represents a significant contribution to Nepal's efforts to develop its substantial hydropower potential. With a planned capacity of 37 MW and expected annual generation of 215.714 gigawatt-hours, the project will bolster the country's renewable energy portfolio while delivering associated infrastructure benefits to a remote and challenging geographical region.

Despite facing obstacles including landslides affecting transportation routes and the logistical challenges inherent to construction in mountainous terrain, the project continues to advance toward its targeted completion in mid-April 2026. The development exemplifies Nepal's increasing capacity to implement medium-scale hydropower projects through domestic financing and technical expertise.

As part of a cluster of hydropower developments in the Myagdi district, this project contributes to a transformative expansion of Nepal's energy infrastructure, with potential long-term benefits for national energy security, economic development, and potentially electricity exports.
