# Comprehensive Research on the Pashupati Area Development Trust in Nepal

## Basic Information

The official name of this infrastructure project is the Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT), known in Nepali as "पशुपति क्षेत्र विकास कोष" (Pashupati Kshetra Vikas Kosh)[^1]. It is classified as a heritage conservation and development trust established to conserve and operate the Pashupatinath Temple and other charitable institutions within the Pashupatinath UNESCO World Heritage Site area[^1][^3]. The Pashupati Area has been officially designated as a national pride project since the fiscal year 2070/71 BS (2013/14 CE), highlighting its strategic importance to Nepal's cultural heritage and development agenda[^2].

## Geographical Coverage

The PADT covers the Pashupati-kshetra (The Area of Pashupati), which is located approximately five kilometers east of the historical center of Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal[^3]. The core monument zone encompasses slightly less than one square kilometer (0.38 square miles) and houses over 500 Hindu religious monuments and artifacts[^3]. The entire temple complex covers an extensive area of 246 hectares (2,460,000 m²)[^5].

The area includes:

- The central Pashupatinath temple (a two-tiered, three-storied pagoda-style temple)
- The Bagmati River running through the area
- A wooded area on the eastern bank of the river
- The settlement of Deopatan, which traditionally begins at the western gate of the temple courtyard
- Wards 7, 8, and 9 of Kathmandu Metropolitan City[^3]


## Timeline and Status

The Pashupati Area Development Trust was established in 1987 under the Pashupati Area Development Trust Act[^1]. The development planning for the area has evolved over time:

- The government initially approved a conceptual master plan for the planned development of the Pashupati Area in 2053 BS (approximately 1996-97 CE)[^2]
- The PADT Governing Council approved a new master plan on December 23, 2022, focusing on developing the area as an international pilgrim site and tourist destination[^2]
- As of February 2023, this latest master plan was awaiting endorsement from the Council of Ministers[^2]

Currently, several projects are in development, including the proposed Pashupati Study Centre near the Nepal Veda Vidyashram, which is estimated to cost Rs 860 million[^4].

## Financial Details

The search results provide limited information about the overall financial structure of the PADT. However, for the proposed Pashupati Study Centre, discussions are underway to collect donations for the project, which has an estimated cost of Rs 860 million[^4].

The trust appears to operate with funding from various sources, and the master plan mentions that "assistances and cooperation with the national and international donors and stakeholders will be encouraged for the development of the Pashupati Area"[^2].

## Implementation Structure

The Pashupati Area Development Trust operates under the Pashupati Area Development Trust Act, 1987[^1]. The governance structure includes:

- PADT Governing Council, chaired by the Minister for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation[^2]
- Executive leadership including:
    - Dr. Milan Kumar Thapa (PADT Member-Secretary)[^2][^4]
    - Dr. Ghanashyam Khatiwada (PADT Executive Director)[^4]

The trust manages day-to-day administration of the Pashupatinath temple and the surrounding area while also carrying out development projects to improve service delivery for pilgrims and tourists[^3].

## Technical Specifications

The Pashupati Area features several notable technical elements:

- Architecture: The area includes various architectural styles - Nepalese-style pagoda architecture, Shikhar (Mountain Peak) style, and Gumbaj (Dome) style[^3]
- Infrastructure elements include:
    - Stone walkways across wooded areas
    - Stepped embankments on both sides of the river for religious activities
    - Elevated embankment across the river for touristic observations
    - Partial fencing of forest area for deer farming
    - Water treatment and sewerage management plant upstream[^3]

The area also contains 519 mini-temples and a main pagoda house within the temple complex[^5].

## Socioeconomic Impact

The Pashupati Area Development Trust manages one of Nepal's most significant religious and cultural sites:

- The temple is classified as a World Heritage Site (since 1979) and is part of the UNESCO designation of Kathmandu Valley[^5]
- Hundreds of thousands of people from Nepal and abroad visit the Pashupatinath Temple for worship annually[^4]
- The temple and surrounding area serve as centers for Hindu religious practices, funerals, and elderly care[^1]
- The newly proposed Study Centre aims to provide resources for those interested in researching oriental philosophy[^4]


## Challenges and Controversies

The search results mention limited challenges, though one significant controversy is noted:

- A news headline in search result[^4] references that the "'Core area' of Pashupati 'sold' to Budha Subba Digital Pvt Ltd..." although details about this issue are not provided in the available excerpt.


## Historical Context

The Pashupati Area has deep historical and cultural significance:

- The temple of Pashupatinath has served as the spiritual protector to all ruling dynasties in Nepal for approximately fifteen hundred years[^3]
- The area includes traditional settlements and systems that have evolved over centuries
- Archaeological investigations have been conducted, including a project led by Robin Coningham from Durham University, UK, from 2014-2016[^3]

The PADT was established in 1987 to formalize the management and development of this historically significant area[^1].

## Future Outlook

The master plan approved by the PADT Governing Council in December 2022 outlines several key future directions:

- Development of the PADT as a tourist destination by conserving tangible and intangible physical and natural heritages[^2]
- Construction of infrastructure to provide improved services and facilities to devotees[^2]
- Promotion and conservation of historical, cultural, religious, spiritual, and artistic aspects of the Pashupati Area[^2]
- Conservation of soil structure, buildings, rivers, and forests[^2]
- Protection of ecology, indigenous animals, and birds[^2]
- Better management of the Guthi (traditional trust) in the Pashupati Area and reestablishment of traditional resources and practices[^2]

A specific project in development is the Pashupati Study Centre, which will serve as a research hub for oriental philosophy. The project will include upgrading the existing Vidyashram (educational institution) run by PADT since 2056 BS and integrating libraries to create a collection with approximately 5,000 books on various subjects including Vedas, Shivapuran, and oriental philosophy[^4].
