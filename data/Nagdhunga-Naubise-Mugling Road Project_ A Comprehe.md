# Nagdhunga-Naubise-Mugling Road Project: A Comprehensive Analysis

The Nagdhunga-Naubise-Mugling (NNM) Road Project represents one of Nepal's most critical transportation infrastructure initiatives, aimed at improving the primary corridor connecting Kathmandu Valley with the rest of the country and neighboring India. Despite its challenging mountainous terrain and complex implementation requirements, this project promises significant improvements in trade efficiency, travel safety, and regional connectivity. This report examines the current status, specifications, and broader implications of this strategically important infrastructure development.

## Basic Information

The official name of this infrastructure initiative is the "Nagdhunga-Naubise-Mugling (NNM) Road Project," though it is also commonly referred to as the "Mugling-Kathmandu Road," "Nagdhunga-Mugling Road Project," or simply the "Mugling Road." This project is classified as a highway infrastructure development, focusing on the upgrading and widening of an existing road corridor.

The NNM Road is part of the Asian Highway (AH-42) network and is universally recognized as "the most important road corridor in Nepal"[^1]. While the search results don't explicitly identify it as a National Pride Project within Nepal's official designation framework, its strategic importance for national connectivity and trade positions it as an infrastructure priority of exceptional significance.

## Geographical Coverage

The Nagdhunga-Naubise-Mugling Road Project spans three districts across two provinces of Nepal. It traverses through Kathmandu district in Bagmati Province, as well as Dhading and Chitwan districts, encompassing several administrative divisions including Chandragiri and Dhunibeshi municipalities and Thakre, Galchhi, Gajuri, and Ichchhakamana rural municipalities[^1].

This strategic highway begins at Nagdhunga, located at the outskirts of Kathmandu City, and terminates at Mugling Town. The total length of the project road along the existing alignment is 94.7 kilometers, divided into two distinct sections:

- Nagdhunga to Naubise (12.3 km): Part of Tribhuwan Rajpath (TRP)
- Naubise to Mugling (82.4 km): Part of Prithvi Rajmarg (PRM)[^1]

The route passes through numerous settlements including Khanikhola, Naubise, Dharke, Mahadevbesi, Thakre, Gajuri, Baireni, Majhimatar, Malekhu, Benighat, Charaudi, Kurintar, and Darechwok before reaching Mugling[^1]. This comprehensive coverage makes it the primary artery connecting the capital region with western, southern, and eastern parts of the country.

## Timeline and Status

The NNM Road Project has been implemented in phases, with different sections progressing at varying rates. While the search results don't provide the initial conception and planning dates, current implementation information indicates ongoing construction across multiple segments.

The project has been divided into sections for efficient implementation:

- Acceleration of construction work after festival seasons, with the contractor increasing workforce from 100 to 150 workers and planning to reach 200 workers[^11]

Bridge construction is advancing simultaneously, with pillars for all six major bridges in the western section having been erected[^5]. Special construction arrangements have required periodic road closures, including a recently implemented three-hour daily closure from 11:00 am to 2:00 pm until December 28, 2024, to facilitate rock cutting at locations including Pokharebhir bend[^4].

## Financial Details

The Nagdhunga-Naubise-Mugling Road Project represents a substantial financial investment in Nepal's transportation infrastructure. The total estimated project cost for the entire Nagdhunga-Naubise-Mugling Road section is approximately NRs 26.54 billion (approximately US\$ 220 million)[^7].

Breaking down the costs by section:

- The western section contract was awarded to Sharma JICG JV at Rs. 4.8 billion, including responsibility for six major bridges over the Gomati, Charoudi, Khatauti, Hugdi, Mauwa, and Barbhang rivers[^5]

The project's funding structure includes:

- International financial assistance from the World Bank, operating under the Nepal India Regional Trade and Transport Project (NIRTTP)[^7][^15]
- Government of Nepal contributions through the Department of Roads

While the search results don't explicitly detail cost overruns, the challenging terrain, geological instability, and implementation complexities suggest potential budget pressures. The project's total estimated cost of NRs 26.54 billion appears to be for the entire Nagdhunga-Naubise-Mugling section, though specific details on budget revisions are not provided in the available information.

## Implementation Structure

The implementation of the Nagdhunga-Naubise-Mugling Road Project follows a structured approach with clear institutional arrangements:

The primary implementing agency is the Department of Roads under the Government of Nepal, with specialized project offices overseeing different sections[^1][^7]. The project management is organized through the Nagdhunga-Mugling Road Project office, which is divided into western and eastern sections for operational efficiency[^4][^5].

Key contractors include:

- Sharma JICG JV: Awarded the contract for the western section (Mugling-Malekhu) at a cost of Rs. 4.8 billion, responsible for both road expansion and the construction of six major bridges[^5][^11]

Several key personnel are involved in project implementation:

- Bijay Darai: Engineer of the Nagdhunga-Mugling Road Project West Section[^4]
- Sachendra Mishra: Information Officer of the Nagdhunga-Mugling Road Project (West Section)[^5]
- Sahan Vaidya: Engineer representing the Sharma-ZICG Joint Venture construction company[^11]

The implementation approach includes coordination with local authorities and stakeholders. For instance, decisions about road closures for construction work were made through meetings at the district administration office in Chitwan, indicating collaborative decision-making with local administrative bodies[^14].

## Technical Specifications

The Nagdhunga-Naubise-Mugling Road Project incorporates several sophisticated technical elements designed to enhance capacity, safety, and resilience along this critical corridor.

The road width specifications vary strategically based on terrain and functional requirements:

- Two-lane sections (9 meters wide): Implemented in areas where cutting through hills and building retaining walls presents significant challenges
- Three-lane sections (12 meters wide): Designed for uphill stretches to facilitate safer traffic movement
- Four-lane sections (18 meters wide): Planned for market areas including Kurintar, Charaudi, Bishaltar, Chumlingtar, and Majhimtar, covering approximately 6 kilometers
- Six-lane sections (26 meters wide): Implemented in urban areas including Mugling, Benighat, and Malekhu bazaar, spanning more than one kilometer[^11][^12]

Bridge infrastructure represents a significant component of the project, with six major bridges under construction in the western section alone. These include crossings over the Gomati, Charoudi, Khatauti, Hugdi, Mauwa, and Barbhang rivers[^5]. Bridge construction has progressed with pillar erection completed for all six bridges, while floor work continues on structures like the Hugdi Bridge[^11].

The project confronts substantial engineering challenges due to the region's difficult topography and geological instability. The road section traverses "geologically difficult and fragile hilly and mountainous terrain,"[^1] requiring specialized construction approaches. In particularly vulnerable areas like Krishnabhir, technical studies are being conducted to determine safe excavation methods before proceeding with construction[^5].

Recent construction activities have included wall cutting, wall construction toward the river side, and preparation for base layers before blacktopping[^11]. Additionally, the project has incorporated temporary traffic management measures, including scheduled road closures to facilitate construction in the most challenging sections[^4].

## Socioeconomic Impact

The Nagdhunga-Naubise-Mugling Road Project carries profound socioeconomic significance for Nepal, serving as the country's most critical transportation artery.

The road functions as "an important trade and transit route for linking Kathmandu Valley with Terai region and India,"[^1] with nearly all goods and passengers from India and other parts of the country traveling through this corridor. The highway serves as the primary gateway to Kathmandu for vehicles arriving from eastern, western, and southern regions[^6]. Daily traffic volume is substantial, with approximately 8,000 vehicles using the road each day[^6].

While the long-term economic benefits are expected to be significant, the construction phase has created temporary challenges for local communities:

- Business activities in areas along the route have been adversely affected by construction delays[^6]
- Extended travel times and traffic congestion during the construction period have impacted transport efficiency
- Local concerns have been raised about the pace of construction, with stakeholders emphasizing the importance of timely completion due to the road's critical role in supply chains[^6]

The project's completion is expected to deliver substantial benefits:

- Improved trade efficiency between Nepal and India, enhancing economic integration
- Reduced transportation costs and travel times across the country's most important logistics corridor
- Enhanced safety through better road geometry, wider carriageways, and improved bridges
- Strengthened resilience against natural hazards like landslides that frequently disrupt transportation

Local stakeholders have emphasized the urgent need for timely project completion, with business representatives noting that "hundreds of passenger buses, goods carriers and ambulances run on the road" and that "construction work should be completed soon to ease transportation."[^6]

## Challenges and Controversies

The Nagdhunga-Naubise-Mugling Road Project faces numerous significant challenges that have affected implementation timelines and operational effectiveness.

The most fundamental challenge stems from the region's difficult topography and geological instability. The road traverses "geologically difficult and fragile hilly and mountainous terrain,"[^1] requiring complex engineering solutions. This is particularly evident at locations like Krishnabhir, where landslides occurred 24 years ago and have recently resurfaced, necessitating careful technical assessment before proceeding with construction[^5].

Implementation progress has been slower than initially planned:

- The Muglin-Malekhu section was described as moving at a "snail's pace," with only 18% completion approximately one year into a three-year contract[^6][^11]
- Construction delays have been attributed to multiple factors, including major Hindu festivals, rainy seasons, and technical challenges in rocky terrain[^5][^6]
- Progress in eastern sections has reportedly been better than in western areas[^6]

The project has also created significant temporary disruptions for road users:

- Periodic road closures have been necessary for construction activities (e.g., three hours daily in December 2024, four hours daily for 21 days in early 2024)[^4][^14]
- Construction has generated dust and congestion, adversely affecting local businesses[^6]
- Local stakeholders have expressed concerns about the pace of implementation, noting the critical importance of this corridor for national connectivity[^6]

Mitigation strategies have included:

- Temporary natural methods to address landslide risks while technical studies are completed[^5]
- Carefully planned road closure schedules with exemptions for emergency vehicles[^4]
- Increased workforce deployment after festival seasons to accelerate progress[^11]
- Technical studies to ensure appropriate approaches for the most challenging sections[^5]


## Historical Context

The Nagdhunga-Naubise-Mugling Road Project builds upon decades of transportation infrastructure development in this critical corridor, addressing longstanding challenges that have affected Nepal's connectivity.

The existing Prithvi Highway, which forms a significant portion of the project area, was originally built with Chinese assistance and completed in 1974[^6]. For nearly five decades, this highway has served as the primary artery connecting Kathmandu with the rest of the country, despite limitations in its original design that have become increasingly problematic as traffic volumes have grown.

The corridor has a history of vulnerability to natural disasters. A particularly devastating landslide occurred at Krishnabhir in August 2000, rendering the area inaccessible for weeks and necessitating the construction of an entirely new road alignment[^5]. This history of geological instability continues to influence construction approaches in the current project.

Nepal has long recognized the need for alternative routes to reduce dependence on this single corridor. Plans for alternatives including the Kathmandu-Nijgadh Expressway, Kanti Rajpath connecting Kathmandu to Hetauda, and Kathmandu-Hetauda Tunnel Road have been proposed, but progress on these initiatives has been slow[^6]. This limited redundancy in Nepal's transportation network has elevated the importance of the NNM Road Project.

The current project builds upon earlier improvements to connected sections. The adjoining Narayanghat-Mugling road section (33 kilometers) was previously upgraded with World Bank support through the Nepal-India Regional Trade and Transport Project (NIRTTP) and completed in 2021[^15]. That project widened the road from 5-5.5 meters to 9-11 meters, incorporating resilient construction techniques suited to the challenging environment[^15].

## Future Outlook

The Nagdhunga-Naubise-Mugling Road Project continues to advance toward completion, with substantial work remaining across multiple sections.

Current implementation focuses on several parallel activities:

- Bridge construction, with six major bridges under various stages of development in the western section[^5][^11]
- Road widening and alignment improvements across different terrain types
- Blacktopping preparation, with base layers being prepared in some sections[^11]
- Technical studies for the most challenging segments, particularly the landslide-prone Krishnabhir area[^5]

The project is designed to integrate with Nepal's broader transportation network improvements:

- The upgraded corridor will function as a key component of the Asian Highway Network (AH-42)[^1][^15]
- It will complement the already-completed Narayanghat-Mugling section, which was widened and upgraded with World Bank support through 2021[^15]
- Enhanced resilience features are likely to include slope protection measures similar to those implemented in the Narayanghat-Mugling section, which combined "bioengineering techniques with plants and grass plantations, small-scale structures, drainage systems, and advanced technology"[^15]

The long-term vision for the project extends beyond basic connectivity to enhance Nepal's trade competitiveness and regional integration:

- Improved road standards will reduce transportation costs and travel times
- Enhanced traffic capacity will accommodate projected growth in vehicle numbers
- Better alignment and safety features will reduce accident rates along this critical corridor
- Strengthened resilience measures will minimize disruptions from landslides and other natural hazards

While the project faces continued implementation challenges, its completion will represent a transformative improvement in Nepal's most critical transportation artery, benefiting trade, passenger transport, and regional connectivity.

## Conclusion

The Nagdhunga-Naubise-Mugling Road Project exemplifies both the significant infrastructure ambitions and persistent implementation challenges that characterize Nepal's development landscape. As the country's most critical transportation corridor linking the capital region with the rest of the nation and neighboring India, this project carries enormous strategic importance despite its complex technical requirements.

The project's multi-faceted approach—incorporating varied road widths based on terrain and functional needs, major bridge construction, and resilience measures—reflects a sophisticated understanding of the corridor's diverse requirements. However, the slow implementation progress highlights the formidable challenges of constructing modern infrastructure in Nepal's mountainous terrain, particularly in geologically unstable areas with histories of devastating landslides.

As construction continues with varied progress across different sections, the project's ultimate success will depend on maintaining momentum despite seasonal constraints, addressing technical challenges in the most difficult terrain, and balancing ongoing transportation needs with construction requirements. When completed, the upgraded Nagdhunga-Naubise-Mugling Road will represent a transformative improvement in Nepal's transportation infrastructure, enhancing national connectivity, trade efficiency, and economic integration for decades to come.
