# Comprehensive Research on the Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu Cross-Border Railway Project

## Basic Information

The official name of this infrastructure project is the "Jilong/Kerung-Kathmandu Cross-Border Railway," also commonly referred to as the "Kerung-Kathmandu Railway" or "Nepal-China Cross-Border Railway Project." This is a railway infrastructure project that represents a significant component of the bilateral cooperation between Nepal and China. While the search results don't explicitly mention a specific project ID designation in national planning, the importance of this project is evident in diplomatic communications, where it has been described as "the most significant initiative in the history of bilateral cooperation" between Nepal and China[^4].

The railway is also an integral part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that Nepal joined in 2017 and forms a key component of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network[^6].

## Geographical Coverage

The Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu Cross-Border Railway is designed to connect Kerung (also spelled as Jilong or Gyirong) in southern Tibet, China, to Kathmandu, Nepal. The railway will traverse through challenging Himalayan terrain, with the line originating from Kerung and connecting to Kathmandu via Rasuwagadhi[^2].

The total length of the railway corridor is approximately 121.48 kilometers, with about 72-75 kilometers lying within Nepal's territory[^2][^3][^6]. According to the preliminary report, 99 percent of the railway would be within Nepal[^2].

The alignment follows the route from Kathmandu to Kerung via Trishuli, with the railway track bifurcating towards Nepal from the railway track going towards Mansarovar of Tibet from a lake above Kerung[^2].

## Timeline and Status

The project's formal inception can be traced to June 21, 2018, when a Memorandum of Understanding was signed during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's visit to China[^3][^4]. Prior to this, a pre-feasibility study had been completed in 2016 by Chinese companies[^1][^7].

Following the 2018 agreement, the China Railway First Survey and Design Institute conducted a month-long technical study of the proposed railway[^7]. In March 2022, during Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Kathmandu, the two sides signed an agreement related to the technical assistance scheme for the feasibility study[^1].

**Current Status:**

- As of March 2025, the project remains in the feasibility study phase
- A six-member Chinese technical team arrived in Kathmandu in December 2022 to begin the detailed feasibility study[^6]
- The study is expected to take approximately 3.5 years to complete due to the complex geological terrain[^6]
- No physical construction has begun, as the project is still in the planning stages
- The most recent joint statement indicated that both sides "expressed satisfaction over the progress of the feasibility study" and planned to hold the 8th Working Meeting on China-Nepal Railway Cooperation "as early as possible"[^5]


## Financial Details

The estimated total cost of the Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu Cross-Border Railway project is approximately \$5.5 billion, a figure equivalent to Nepal's total government revenues in 2018[^5]. The 72.5-kilometer stretch within Nepal alone is estimated to cost around \$2.75 billion[^5]. Earlier estimates cited costs of over \$3 billion due to difficult geophysical terrain and other complexities[^6][^7].

For the initial phases, China provided a Rs 2 billion (approximately \$19.9 million) grant for railway planning and development[^3]. The feasibility study expenses, totaling 180.47 million RMB, are being covered under grant assistance from China as stipulated in the Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation between the governments of Nepal and China signed on August 15, 2017[^1].

A major obstacle to the project's progress is that the two countries have not been able to agree on its financing modality, making substantial advancement less likely in the near term[^5].

## Implementation Structure

The implementation of the Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu Cross-Border Railway involves several key stakeholders:

- On the Nepali side, the Department of Railways is the primary implementing agency, with Rohit Kumar Bisural serving as the Director General[^2][^6]
- The China Railway First Survey and Design Institute Group is conducting the feasibility study via a Chinese government grant[^6]
- A six-member Chinese technical team arrived in Kathmandu in December 2022 to carry out the detailed feasibility study[^6]

The agreement between Nepal and China outlines specific responsibilities for each party. China is responsible for undertaking the feasibility study works, dispatching technical personnel to Nepal, and conducting six relevant technical studies[^1]. Nepal is responsible for providing the project's basic data, gathering information as required, conducting environmental impact assessments and resettlement planning, and facilitating the work of Chinese personnel in Nepal[^1].

## Technical Specifications

The Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu Cross-Border Railway faces significant technical challenges due to the extreme terrain it must traverse. According to the feasibility study, engineers would need to build ramps along the northern and southern slopes leading to Lake Paiku, near Kerung, to connect the tracks to the Kathmandu section[^7].

The project presents six major geological challenges as identified in technical studies:

- Hard rock burst and large deformation of soft rocks causing extremely high stress
- Fault effects of deep, active fractures in high-intensity seismic areas
- Seismic activities, high ground temperatures, slope stability issues, debris flows, and water erosion[^7]

The section with the longest and steepest grade extends up to 95 kilometers of the total 121-kilometer route. Continuous use of air braking on these grades would cause serious abrasion of brake shoes, tire overheating, and other operational dangers[^7].

A distinguishing feature of this railway is that most of it would run through tunnels due to the mountainous terrain[^2]. The technical studies being conducted include evaluation of regional crustal stability, activity of active faults, seismic safety, debris flow, landslides, and tunnel portal slopes[^1].

## Socioeconomic Impact

The Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu Cross-Border Railway is expected to deliver significant socioeconomic benefits to Nepal:

- Enhanced bilateral trade: The railway will boost two-way trade and people-to-people exchanges between China and Nepal[^6]
- Employment opportunities: The project is anticipated to create substantial employment for Nepali people during both construction and operational phases[^6]
- Improved economic conditions: The railway has the potential to transform the socioeconomic conditions of Nepal, especially in regions along the route[^6]
- Tourism development: Improved connectivity will likely increase tourism between the countries[^6]
- Strategic connectivity: As part of the BRI and Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network, the railway will enhance Nepal's position in regional trade networks[^2][^6]

Local perspectives on the project are generally positive, with one student from Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu describing it as "our necessity, our dream, this is the way to our prosperity"[^6]. Similarly, trade representatives view the project as beneficial for Nepal's economic development[^6].

## Challenges and Controversies

The Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu Cross-Border Railway faces several significant challenges:

**Technical Challenges:**

- Complicated geological terrain requiring complex engineering solutions[^7]
- The railway must pass through rugged Himalayan high mountains necessitating extensive tunneling[^7]
- Located in the "collision and splicing zone" along the Eurasian Plate, presenting seismic risks[^7]
- Steep grades that create operational challenges and safety concerns[^7]

**Administrative and Financial Challenges:**

- Lack of agreement between Nepal and China on the financing modality[^5]
- Bureaucratic delays, with officials from different ministries (foreign affairs, finance, and physical infrastructure) blaming each other for delays in reaching agreements[^1]
- Limited technical expertise in Nepal to effectively engage with neighboring countries on such major projects[^5]

**Implementation Concerns:**

- The sheer scale of investment required (\$5.5 billion) relative to Nepal's economic capacity[^5]
- Questions about the long-term debt implications for Nepal if loans are used for financing
- Complex coordination required between multiple government agencies in both countries


## Historical Context

The Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu Cross-Border Railway project emerged within the context of Nepal's increasing engagement with China's Belt and Road Initiative. Nepal formally joined the BRI in 2017, setting the stage for this ambitious railway project[^6].

The formal agreement for the railway was signed during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's visit to China in June 2018[^3][^4][^7]. This was followed by additional agreements during Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Kathmandu in March 2022 and during President Bidya Devi Bhandari's visit to China[^1][^2].

The railway is planned to be part of a larger 550-kilometer railroad connecting the Tibetan city of Shigatse with Kerung near the Nepal-China border, representing a significant expansion of China's railway network into the Himalayan region[^6].

## Future Outlook

As of March 2025, the Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu Cross-Border Railway project remains in the feasibility study phase, with substantial work still to be completed before construction can begin:

- The feasibility study is expected to continue for approximately 3.5 years total from its 2022 start date[^6]
- Construction would follow after completion of the study, depending on financial arrangements
- According to earlier estimates, the construction itself could take 5-7 years to complete[^7]

For the project to advance, Nepal and China must resolve the financing modality issue, which has been a significant obstacle[^5]. Additionally, the technical challenges identified in the preliminary studies must be addressed through careful engineering design.

If completed, the railway would significantly enhance Nepal's connectivity with China, potentially transforming trade patterns and economic development in the region. It represents a cornerstone of the larger Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network, which aims to integrate transportation infrastructure across the Himalayan region[^2][^6].

The railway also connects with other infrastructure initiatives, including the broader development of the Belt and Road Initiative in South Asia and the improvement of road connectivity between Nepal and China, particularly the currently poor conditions of highways connecting Kathmandu to border points in Rasuwagadhi and Tatopani[^5].
