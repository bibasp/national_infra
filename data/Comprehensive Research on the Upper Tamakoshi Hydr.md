# Comprehensive Research on the Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The official name of this infrastructure project is the Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project. It is classified as a 456 MW peaking run-of-the-river hydroelectric project, making it the largest hydroelectric project in Nepal. The project has been designated as a "Nepal national priority project," highlighting its strategic importance to the country's energy infrastructure development.[^1]

## Geographical Coverage

The Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project is located in the Gaurishankar Conservation Area in Dolakha District, which is part of Nepal's Bagmati Province. The project is situated on the Tamakoshi River (also spelled Tama Koshi), a tributary of the Sapt Koshi river, near the Nepal–Tibet border. The project site is approximately 200km away from Kathmandu.[^1][^2]

The project's dam is positioned at coordinates 27°55′30″N 86°12′47″E, while the overall project is located at coordinates 27°50′38″N 86°13′05″E.[^1]

## Timeline and Status

The development of the Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project followed these key milestones:

- March 2007: Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Limited was established by Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) to develop and operate the project[^2]
- 2011: Construction began[^1]
- Initial projected completion: Expected to be completed within six years (approximately 2017)[^2]
- Delays: Project progress was hampered due to an earthquake in April 2015[^2]
- Revised completion: Scheduled for commissioning by the end of 2019 (according to older information)[^2]
- July 2021: The project became operational[^1][^3]

Current status: The project is fully operational as of March 2025.[^1]

## Financial Details

The financial structure of the Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project reveals significant domestic investment:

- Initial budgeted amount: NPR35.29bn (\$441m) in 2011[^2]
- Revised budget: Additional \$41.8m due to the delay and disruption caused by the 2015 earthquake[^2]

Funding sources:

- Nepal's Employees' Provident Fund: \$131.6m
- Nepal Telecom: \$78.97m
- Citizen Investment Trust: \$26.32m
- Rastriya Beema Sansthan (RBS): \$26.32m
- Government of Nepal loan: Up to NPR11.08bn (\$145.8m)[^2]

Notably, the project was entirely financed from domestic financial institutions and companies, making it a significant achievement for Nepal's self-reliance in infrastructure development.[^1]

## Implementation Structure

The implementation of the Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project involved several key stakeholders:

- Developer/Owner: Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Limited, an autonomous company established by Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) in March 2007[^2][^3]

Contractors:

- Detailed project design, construction management and monitoring: Norconsult and Lahmeyer[^2]
- Civil works: Sinohydro Corporation[^2]
- Electromechanical equipment (turbines and generators): Andritz Hydro[^2][^3]
- Transmission lines and substation: KEC International[^2]
- Hydro-mechanical works: Texmaco (an engineering and infrastructure company based in India)[^2]


## Technical Specifications

The Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project incorporates several advanced engineering features:

- Dam specifications: 22m-high and 60m-long concrete dam[^1][^2]
- Hydraulic head: 822m gross, 805m net[^1][^3]
- Powerhouse: Underground hall (142m-long, 13m-wide, and 25m-high)[^1][^2]
- Turbines: 6 Pelton wheels, each with 76MW nameplate capacity[^1][^3]
- Generators: 6 units, each with 90 MVA capacity[^3]
- Transmission: 49km-long double circuit 220kV transmission line between Gongar and the Khimti power station[^2]
- De-sanding basins: Two 225m-long basins[^2]
- Headrace tunnel: 8.4km-long with 32.14m² cross-sectional area[^2]
- Penstock length: 1,134m[^3]
- Tailrace tunnel: 2.9km-long with 35m² cross-sectional area[^2]
- Design flood capacity: 885m³/s[^2]
- Design discharge capacity: 66m³/s[^2]
- Live storage capacity: 1.2 million cubic metres[^2]
- Annual generation: 2,281 GWh[^1][^3]


## Socioeconomic Impact

The Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project has significant socioeconomic implications for Nepal:

- It is the largest hydroelectric plant in Nepal, with a power output equivalent to two-thirds of Nepal's power generation (as of when it was built)[^1]
- The power generated is sold to Nepal Electricity Authority under a power purchase agreement at a yearly average rate of NPR3.50 per unit[^2][^3]
- The project significantly enhances Nepal's electricity generation capacity with its 456 MW output


## Challenges and Controversies

The Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project faced several challenges during implementation:

- The 2015 earthquake in Nepal significantly impacted the project's progress, causing delays in construction[^2]
- These delays led to cost escalation of approximately \$41.8m beyond the initial budget[^2]


## Historical Context

The Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project was conceived as a solution to Nepal's chronic electricity shortages. The development company, Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Limited, was established by Nepal Electricity Authority in March 2007 specifically to develop this project.[^2]

A draft power purchase agreement (PPA) between Nepal Electricity Authority and Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Limited was signed in 2011, laying the groundwork for the project's financial sustainability.[^2]

## Future Outlook

As the project is now operational (since July 2021), it represents a significant achievement in Nepal's energy sector development. The Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project:

- Adds 456 MW to Nepal's electricity generation capacity
- Produces 2,281 GWh of electricity annually[^1][^3]
- Serves as a model of successful domestic financing for large infrastructure projects

The project's successful completion showcases Nepal's growing capacity to develop large-scale infrastructure projects and helps address the country's electricity needs, supporting broader economic development goals.
