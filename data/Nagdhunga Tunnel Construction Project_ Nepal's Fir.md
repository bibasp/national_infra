# Nagdhunga Tunnel Construction Project: Nepal's First Road Tunnel Infrastructure

The Nagdhunga Tunnel Construction Project represents a significant milestone in Nepal's infrastructure development history, marking the country's first modern mountainous traffic road tunnel. This breakthrough project aims to improve connectivity between Kathmandu Valley and the rest of the country, addressing longstanding transportation challenges at one of the capital's key entry points.

## Basic Information

The Nagdhunga Tunnel Construction Project, also referred to as the Nagdhunga-Naubise Tunnel Project or Nagdhunga-Sisnekhola Tunnel, is a road infrastructure project designed to serve as an alternative transportation route to the existing congested and winding road at Nagdhunga pass[^1][^3]. This pioneering project represents Nepal's first commercial tunnel route and has been designated as a milestone achievement in the country's developmental history[^8]. While the search results don't explicitly mention a National Pride Project designation, the significance and scale of the project, along with the extensive government and international cooperation involved, suggest its high national importance.

### Project Type and Classification

- Transportation infrastructure (road tunnel)
- First mountainous traffic road tunnel in Nepal


## Geographical Coverage

The Nagdhunga Tunnel traverses through the hills in the western part of the Kathmandu Valley, connecting Kathmandu district with Dhading district. Specifically, it links:

- Eastern portal: Satungal/Basnetchhap/Totipakha in Chandragiri Municipality-1, Kathmandu[^2][^16]
- Western portal: Sisnekhola in Dhading district[^2][^16]

The project covers the following key dimensions:

- Main tunnel: 2.68 kilometers long[^2][^3][^16]
- Evacuation tunnel (parallel to main tunnel): 2.55 kilometers long[^2]
- Approach roads: 2.3 kilometers (east) and 0.6 kilometers (west), totaling 2.9 kilometers[^1][^15]
- Additional infrastructure: Flyovers, bridges, and culverts[^1][^2]

The tunnel passes under the Sisne khola to Nagdhunga pass, reducing the distance between Thankot and Naubise from 9 kilometers to 5.7 kilometers[^5][^16].

## Timeline and Status

- Unexpected geological challenges requiring additional engineering solutions
- Repeated floods and collapses during excavation work
- Landslides on slope faces requiring additional stabilization efforts[^3][^4][^14]


### Local Issues and Disputes

- Protests by local communities halting construction multiple times
- Demands for compensation and designation of the area as "affected area"
- Water source depletion concerns requiring mitigation
- Land acquisition challenges and disagreements over compensation rates[^7][^11]


### Technical and Administrative Challenges

- Weak rock formations requiring additional support structures
- Delayed import of explosives and construction equipment
- Lack of operational plan and working procedures for tunnel operation
- Pending electricity supply connection for over three months[^11][^13]


### Mitigation Strategies

- Deadline extensions to accommodate delays
- Formation of a task force to draft operational procedures
- Compensation and rent provision for affected households
- Planned Japanese technical expertise for final testing and quality assurance[^3][^6][^11][^13]


## Historical Context

The Nagdhunga Tunnel Construction Project emerged from a recognized need to address severe traffic congestion and safety issues at the Nagdhunga-Naubise section, which has long been:

- Prone to gridlock due to multiple hairpin bends
- Vulnerable to landslides and weather-related disruptions
- A bottleneck for transportation between Kathmandu and the rest of Nepal[^9]

The tunnel represents Nepal's first venture into modern tunnel infrastructure, building on previous Japanese-supported transportation projects in Nepal, including:

- BP Highway (also known as Banepa-Bardibas Highway)
- Koteshwor-Suryabinayak road section[^2]

The project aligns with Nepal's broader infrastructure development strategy, introducing tunnel technology that may be replicated in other mountainous regions of the country.

## Future Outlook

### Remaining Work

- Interior finishing work including lining and equipment installation
- Electrical and ventilation systems completion
- Road surface finishing inside the tunnel and on approach roads
- Flyover completion and remaining infrastructure work[^11][^14]


### Operational Plans

- Japanese technical team (20 experts) expected to arrive in April for tunnel testing
- Ministry forming a task force to draft tunnel operation procedures
- Likely to award contract to private sector for tunnel operations
- Soft opening planned with limited vehicle access before full operation[^3][^11][^13]


### Long-term Vision

- Expected to serve as a model for future tunnel projects in Nepal
- Will contribute to Nepal's goal of enhancing connectivity across its mountainous terrain
- Part of the strategic improvement of the national highway network connecting Kathmandu with the Indian border in the south[^8][^9]

The Nagdhunga Tunnel Construction Project represents not just an infrastructure development but a significant step in Nepal's infrastructure modernization journey, introducing tunnel construction expertise and setting a precedent for future similar projects in the country's challenging mountainous terrain.
