# Kalanki Underpass Bridge: Nepal's Pioneering Underground Road Infrastructure

The Kalanki Underpass Bridge represents a significant milestone in Nepal's transportation infrastructure development, marking the country's first underground road passage in its capital city. This pioneering project has transformed one of Kathmandu's most congested intersections into a more efficient traffic corridor while serving as a model for future urban transportation solutions in the country.

## Basic Information

The Kalanki Underpass is officially part of the broader "Koteshwor-Balkhu Bridge-Kalanki Ring Road Reform Project." It is frequently referred to simply as the "Kalanki Underpass" or "Nepal's first underground road." As a transportation infrastructure project, it is classified as an underpass—a road tunnel designed to allow traffic to flow beneath a busy intersection without interruption.

While the search results don't explicitly designate it as a National Pride Project within Nepal's formal classification system, the Kalanki Underpass is consistently described as "historic in infrastructure development in the country"[^2] and "the first underpass of its kind constructed in Nepal"[^1]. This pioneering status underscores its significance within Nepal's infrastructure landscape as the nation's first major underground road project.

## Geographical Coverage

The Kalanki Underpass is strategically located in Kalanki, a critical junction in Kathmandu that serves as one of the main gateways to the capital city. It spans 800 meters, extending from Khasibazar to Bafal Chowk along the Ring Road[^2][^7][^10]. This location is particularly significant as it sits at the intersection of two major travel routes: the Koteshor-Swayambhu road and the Kalimati-Thankot road[^1].

The underpass is an integral component of Kathmandu's 28-kilometer Ring Road, specifically enhancing the 10.4-kilometer Koteshwor-Balkhu Bridge-Kalanki section that has undergone significant expansion and improvement[^4]. By creating a grade-separated crossing at this critical junction, the project alleviates traffic congestion at what was previously one of Kathmandu's most notorious bottlenecks.

## Timeline and Status

The development of the Kalanki Underpass has followed a complex timeline spanning several years:

The project was initiated in 2013 as part of the broader Ring Road improvement effort[^1][^10][^15]. Initial construction work began in December 2013, with original projections estimating completion within two years[^6].

However, the project faced several significant delays:

- The devastating April 2015 earthquake in Nepal temporarily halted construction activities[^1][^10][^15]
- The subsequent trade embargo by India created shortages of essential construction materials and fuel[^10][^15]

After these setbacks, revised completion dates were established:

- In November 2017, officials announced an anticipated completion date of June 2018, with approximately 40% of construction completed at that point[^8]
- In February 2018, project officials revised the target, stating the underpass would be ready in five months (by July 2018)[^15]

The Kalanki Underpass was ultimately opened to the public in August 2018, though this was described as an "informal" opening, with final inauguration planned for December 2018[^10]. The underpass opened with some work still pending, including dividers, traffic signs, light signals, and an additional layer of asphalt[^10].

*Note: There appears to be some confusion in recent reporting, as articles from March 2025 reference the underpass as still nearing completion[^2][^14]. This likely reflects either reprinted older content or possibly refers to additional work being done on the broader Ring Road project.*

## Financial Details

The Kalanki Underpass was primarily funded through international assistance, specifically a grant from the People's Republic of China. The total funding provided was 512 million Chinese Yuan, equivalent to approximately Rs. 5.13 billion (about \$5 billion at the time)[^1][^2][^7][^10].

This financial support covered not just the underpass itself but the broader Ring Road improvement project, which included expanding the 10.4-kilometer stretch from Koteshwor to Kalanki into an eight-lane road[^4]. The project represents a significant foreign investment in Nepal's infrastructure development and exemplifies the growing Chinese involvement in South Asian infrastructure projects.

The available information does not indicate any significant cost overruns beyond the initial budget allocation, though the project did experience timeline extensions due to external factors including the 2015 earthquake and subsequent trade embargo.

## Implementation Structure

The Kalanki Underpass was implemented under the oversight of the Kathmandu Ring Road Improvement Project (KRRIIP), with Prakash Bhandari serving as the project manager[^10]. This organization appears to have operated under the broader authority of Nepal's Department of Roads and the Ring Road Development Project.

Key figures involved in project implementation included:

- Prakash Bhandari: Project Chief/Manager at KRRIIP[^2][^10]
- Gyanendra Kumar Jha: Director of Ring Road Development Project (mentioned in 2017 reports)[^7][^8]
- Niranjan Sharma: Engineer at KRRIIP[^15]

The primary contractor for construction was Shanghai Construction Group, a Chinese construction company[^1][^10][^11][^15]. This matches the project's funding source, as Chinese financial assistance for infrastructure often involves Chinese construction firms. During the project's opening phase in August 2018, the Metropolitan Traffic Police Office in Kalanki provided support by deploying 36 traffic personnel to guide drivers through the new underpass[^10].

## Technical Specifications

The Kalanki Underpass represents significant technical achievement as Nepal's first major underground road infrastructure. Its key specifications include:

- Length: 800 meters extending from Khasibazar to Bafal Chowk[^2][^7][^10]
- Width: Four lanes (two in each direction) in the underground portion[^2][^7][^10]
- Design configuration: The underpass allows through traffic on the Ring Road to pass beneath the intersection, while separate service lanes on the upper deck accommodate vehicles accessing residential areas and local destinations[^10][^15]

The design purposefully separates different traffic flows:

- Vehicles traveling between Balkhu and Swoyambhu can continue without stopping at Kalanki by using the underpass[^7]
- Local traffic and vehicles needing to turn at Kalanki use the surface-level roads
- Pedestrians are not permitted in the underpass and must use overhead bridges or zebra crossings to cross the road[^7]

The construction process involved significant excavation work, with a tunnel being dug for the underpass as mentioned in 2017 reports[^6]. The project incorporated modern road construction techniques, though specific technical standards are not detailed in the available information.

The design includes provisions for traffic management features such as dividers, traffic signs, and light signals, though some of these elements were still pending at the time of initial opening in August 2018[^10].

## Socioeconomic Impact

The Kalanki Underpass has delivered substantial benefits to Kathmandu's transportation network and the surrounding community, addressing what was previously a major urban congestion point.

Before the construction of the underpass, Kalanki experienced severe traffic problems:

- Approximately 8,000 different vehicles carrying over 70,000 individuals traveled through Kalanki daily[^1][^10]
- Commuters frequently endured traffic delays of over two hours at this intersection[^10]
- The area suffered from high levels of pollution, congestion, and disorder[^11]

The completed underpass has significantly alleviated these issues:

- Traffic now flows smoothly through the junction, with vehicles on the Ring Road having uninterrupted passage via the underpass[^10]
- Separate lanes on the sides ensure smooth flow for vehicles accessing residential areas[^10]
- Local residents report substantial quality-of-life improvements, with one 30-year resident stating that the area is now "wide, clean and dust-free"[^11]

The project has particularly benefited:

- Daily commuters passing through Kalanki
- Residents of nearby areas such as Bafal
- Transport entrepreneurs and business operators
- The broader Kathmandu Valley population through improved urban mobility

While specific employment generation figures aren't provided, the project created construction jobs during implementation and has improved business conditions in what was previously a highly congested area.

## Challenges and Controversies

The Kalanki Underpass project encountered several significant challenges during its implementation:

The 2015 Nepal earthquake caused a major disruption to construction activities, temporarily pausing the project at a critical phase[^1][^10][^15]. This natural disaster, which devastated much of Nepal, created inevitable delays for infrastructure projects across the country.

Following the earthquake, an Indian trade embargo resulted in acute shortages of construction materials and fuel, further impeding progress[^10][^15]. These two consecutive crises extended the project timeline considerably beyond initial projections.

During the extended construction period, local communities faced significant hardships:

- Kalanki became "one of the most polluted areas in the Capital" due to construction dust[^6]
- Local residents and businesses suffered from poor air quality, noise pollution, and access difficulties[^6]
- Pedestrians faced hazardous conditions with limited walking space as vehicles encroached on footpaths[^6]
- Local households "had no option but to bear the noise and pollution endlessly"[^6]

The project also faced technical challenges that delayed the planned June 2018 opening to August 2018, though specific details of these technical issues aren't elaborated in the available information[^10].

Despite these obstacles, the project was ultimately completed, though initially with some features still pending. The Metropolitan Traffic Police deployed 36 traffic personnel to manage the transition when the underpass first opened, helping drivers adjust to the new traffic pattern[^10].

## Historical Context

The Kalanki Underpass represents a significant evolution in Nepal's transportation infrastructure development, particularly in relation to Kathmandu's Ring Road system.

The original 27-kilometer Ring Road was constructed in 1977 with Chinese assistance[^11], establishing the primary circular route around Kathmandu. As the city grew dramatically over subsequent decades, the original road became increasingly inadequate for the volume of traffic, particularly at major intersections like Kalanki.

The current underpass project emerged as part of a comprehensive Ring Road improvement initiative that began in 2013[^10][^11][^15]. This broader effort aimed to expand the 10.5-kilometer Koteshwor-Kalanki section from the original four lanes to eight or ten lanes, including dedicated spaces for pedestrians and cyclists[^7][^9].

The selection of Kalanki for Nepal's first underpass was strategic, as this junction represented one of the most congested points in Kathmandu's transportation network. The success of this pioneering project has influenced planning for similar infrastructure at other key intersections, with studies initiated for potential underpasses at Naya Baneshwor and Maharajgunj[^13].

The project also reflects strengthening Nepal-China relations in infrastructure development, as noted by Nepal's Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli, who stated: "We are economically back so we are in high need of support and assistance from our neighbors. China's support is crucial for us to achieve the national goal of 'Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali'"[^11].

## Future Outlook

The successful implementation of the Kalanki Underpass has established a precedent for similar infrastructure solutions at other congested intersections in Kathmandu. Building on this achievement, several related initiatives are either planned or under consideration:

The Department of Roads has initiated feasibility studies for constructing similar underpasses at two additional major Kathmandu intersections:

- Naya Baneshwor junction
- Maharajgunj intersection

Unlike the Kalanki project, these new underpasses are expected to be constructed with domestic investment, though a Chinese company has expressed interest in the Maharajgunj project[^13].

Additionally, the broader Ring Road improvement project continues with plans for:

- Second phase expansion of the 8.5-kilometer section from Kalanki to Maharajgunj[^4]
- Potential future development of the Maharajgunj-Koteshwor section, though specific plans for this segment were not finalized as of 2024[^4]

A complementary proposal involves the construction of a Balambu-Kalanki flyover at an estimated cost of Rs. 13 billion. This project, which could take three years to complete, is closely tied to the Nagdhunga-Naubise tunnel road construction and aims to address potential future congestion as traffic patterns evolve[^3].

As Kathmandu continues to grow, these infrastructure improvements reflect an evolving approach to urban transportation planning that increasingly embraces grade-separated solutions like underpasses and flyovers to manage traffic at key intersections.

## Conclusion

The Kalanki Underpass stands as a landmark achievement in Nepal's transportation infrastructure development. As the country's first underground road passage, it has successfully transformed one of Kathmandu's most notoriously congested intersections into a smoother traffic corridor while demonstrating the viability of such solutions in Nepal's urban context.

Despite facing significant challenges during construction, including a devastating earthquake and subsequent trade embargo, the project was successfully completed in 2018 and has delivered substantial benefits to commuters, local residents, and the broader transportation network. The project's implementation through Chinese financial and technical assistance highlights the importance of international cooperation in Nepal's infrastructure development.

The success of the Kalanki Underpass has influenced planning for similar infrastructure elsewhere in Kathmandu, potentially marking the beginning of a new approach to managing traffic at the city's major intersections. As Nepal continues to develop and urbanize, the Kalanki project provides valuable lessons and a model for future transportation infrastructure initiatives aimed at improving urban mobility and quality of life.
