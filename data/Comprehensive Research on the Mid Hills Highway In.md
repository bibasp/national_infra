# Comprehensive Research on the Mid Hills Highway Infrastructure Project in Nepal

The Mid Hills Highway represents one of Nepal's most ambitious transportation infrastructure initiatives, aiming to connect the nation's hills region from east to west. This article examines this significant national project in detail.

## Basic Information

The infrastructure project is officially known as the Mid Hills Highway (मध्य पहाडी लोकमार्ग). It is also referred to by several alternative names including Pushpalal Highway or Pushpalal Mid-Hill Highway (named after the founding general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal), and Madhya Pahadi Lokmarga[^3][^4]. In the national infrastructure database, it is designated as project ID: TR-HW-002[^2].

The Mid Hills Highway is classified as a national highway under the transportation infrastructure category[^2]. Importantly, it has been designated as a National Pride Project by the Government of Nepal, placing it among the nation's most significant infrastructure developments[^2][^5]. It is also listed as one of the 21 nationally prioritized projects[^4].

## Geographical Coverage

The Mid Hills Highway traverses through multiple provinces, directly connecting 24-26 hilly districts across the country[^3][^4][^5]. According to the project alignment, the highway passes through:

- Eastern Nepal (Province 1): Panchthar, Terathum, Dhankuta, Bhojpur, Khotang, Okhaldhunga
- Central Nepal (primarily Bagmati Province): Sindhuli, Kavre, Nuwakot, Dhading
- Gandaki Province: Gorkha, Lamjung, Kaski, Parbat, Baglung
- Lumbini, Karnali and Sudurpashchim Provinces: Rukum, Jajarkot, Dailekh, Achham, Doti, Dadeldhura, Baitadi[^4]

The highway begins at Chiyo Bhanjyang in Panchthar District in the east and concludes at Jhulaghat in Baitadi District in the far west[^3][^5][^6]. This ambitious project spans approximately 1,776-1,879 kilometers (sources vary slightly on the exact length), making it the longest national highway in Nepal upon completion[^3][^5][^11].

The alignment of the highway has been adjusted over time. Rather than passing through Kathmandu as initially planned, the route was revised to follow a more northerly path via Sindhupalchok, Nuwakot, Dhading, Gorkha, and Lamjung to connect to Pokhara, with potential plans to bypass Pokhara city by routing along the northern side of Begnas Lake[^3].

## Timeline and Status

**Conception and Planning:**

- The concept of the Mid-Hill Highway was introduced in the fiscal year 2064/65 BS (2007/08)[^5][^6]

**Implementation Timeline:**

- Construction work officially started in 2007-08[^6]
- Initial projected completion date: 2017/18 (fiscal year 2074/75 BS)[^5]
- Current revised deadline: By the end of fiscal year 2079/80 BS (approximately 2023)[^5]

**Current Status and Progress:**

- Status: Ongoing[^2][^5]
- Physical completion: Approximately 64-64.16% as of the last available data[^5][^11]
- Out of the total 1,879 km, about 1,259 kilometers have been blacktopped[^5]
- 93 out of 137 bridges have been completed[^5]
- Currently, 415 kilometers of road and 25 bridges remain under construction[^5][^11]
- Contracts for 205 km of road and 19 bridges remain to be signed[^11]


## Financial Details

**Budget Evolution:**

- Initial budget estimate: Approximately Rs 33 billion[^5]
- Current/revised budget: Over Rs 101 billion (more than triple the initial estimate)[^5]

**Annual Allocations:**

- FY 2016: Rs 1.21 billion allocated[^6]

**Funding Structure:**

- Primary funding source: Government of Nepal budget (domestic investment)[^5][^6]
- No specific foreign aid or loans mentioned in the available information

**Cost Overruns:**

- The project cost has tripled from the initial estimate of Rs 33 billion to over Rs 101 billion[^5]
- Reasons for overruns include delays in implementation, contractor issues, and changes in project scope and alignment[^5]


## Implementation Structure

**Implementing Agencies:**

- Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MoPPW)[^6]
- Department of Roads[^10]
- Pushpalal Mid-Hill Highway Project Directorate[^5][^11]

**Project Leadership:**

- Project Director: Harikumar Pokharel (as mentioned in the most recent information)[^5]
- Project Information Officer: Suraj Adhikari[^11]

**Contractors:**

- Multiple contractors involved across different sections
- Notable mention of issues with some contractors, including Shrestha Construction and Transport Service for the Baglung-Akshyate-Ghodabandhe road section[^7]


## Technical Specifications

**Design Standards:**

- Planned width: 7-meter wide blacktopped road[^6]
- Additional features: 0.5-meter wide gravelled shoulder on either side[^6]
- Drainage: 1 meter allocated for drainage systems[^6]

While detailed information on construction materials and environmental mitigation measures is limited in the available search results, the project faces technical challenges related to the hilly terrain and environmental permissions, particularly regarding tree cutting along the right of way[^10].

## Socioeconomic Impact

**Expected Beneficiaries:**

- Approximately 7-10 million people living in 24-26 hilly districts[^5][^6][^11]
- 215 settlements along the highway corridor[^5][^11]

**Development Initiatives:**

- Establishment of 10 model cities along the highway corridor[^3][^4][^9]
- The planned model cities include: Phidim (Panchthar), Basantapur (Terhathum), Khurkot (Sindhuli), Baireni Galchhi (Dhading), Dumre (Tanahun), Burtibang (Baglung), Chaurjahari (Rukum), Rakam (Dailekh), Sanfebagar (Achham) and Patan (Baitadi)[^3][^4]

**Strategic Benefits:**

- Reduce migration from hilly regions to Terai and larger cities[^3][^4][^9]
- Provide essential services including food, education, healthcare, and other basic needs to hill communities[^3][^9]
- Create marketing opportunities and economic development in previously isolated areas[^9]
- Improve accessibility to less accessible communities in the mid-hill areas of Nepal[^9]


## Challenges and Controversies

**Major Implementation Obstacles:**

- Land acquisition issues, although people are voluntarily providing land in many areas[^10]
- Obstruction by locals in several districts, particularly in Dailekh, Jajarkot, and Rukum in the Mid-Western Region[^6]
- Confusion over road alignment, especially near the Budhigandaki High-dam Multipurpose Project site and in Kaski district[^11]

**Material and Administrative Challenges:**

- Unavailability of construction materials due to tightened provisions by local bodies regarding construction materials mining and transportation[^10]
- Cumbersome process for obtaining permission to cut trees along the highway's right of way[^10]
- Contractors abandoning work or going out of contact, as in the case of the Baglung-Akshyate-Ghodabandhe road section[^7]
- Inadequate budget allocations in some fiscal years[^6]

**Mitigation Approaches:**

- Route realignment in problematic areas, such as the Kaski section[^11]
- Coordination with other infrastructure projects like the Budhigandaki Reservoir Project[^11]
- Request for special provisions for smooth and easy supply of construction materials for national pride projects[^10]


## Historical Context

The Mid-Hill Highway concept emerged as a strategic response to Nepal's geographical and developmental challenges. With the country divided into three main regions—the southern Terai plains, northern Himalayan mountains, and middle hilly region—the highway was conceived to enhance connectivity in the previously underserved mid-hills[^3].

The project was named after Pushpa Lal Shrestha, the founding general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal, highlighting its political significance[^6]. When introduced in 2007/08, it represented a major shift in Nepal's infrastructure development strategy, focusing on domestic investment for a project that would create an alternative to the existing East-West Highway that runs through the plains[^6].

The project has undergone significant changes in scope and design, including route realignment to bypass major urban centers like Kathmandu and potentially Pokhara to reduce congestion[^3]. This represents an evolution in thinking about the highway's role—from simply connecting districts to strategically managing urbanization and population distribution.

## Future Outlook

**Remaining Work:**

- Approximately 620 kilometers of road yet to be paved[^5]
- Contracts for 205 km of road and 19 bridges still need to be signed[^11]
- Blacktopping of several sections, including some in Baglung district[^7]

**Projected Timeline:**

- According to the Project Director, it will take at least four more years to complete the project, despite the current deadline being only 11 months away[^5]

**Development Vision:**

- The highway is expected to create a network of 10 model cities, redistributing population and economic opportunities away from overcrowded urban centers[^3][^4][^9]
- It aims to provide a foundation for balanced regional development, particularly addressing the needs of the mid-hill communities that have historically faced economic stagnation and outmigration[^9]
- The project forms part of Nepal's broader strategy to improve internal connectivity, catalyze regional development, and create alternatives to migration to Kathmandu and the Terai region[^9]

The Mid Hills Highway represents more than just a transportation corridor; it embodies Nepal's vision for distributed development, reduced urban migration, and economic opportunities in previously isolated regions. Despite significant challenges and delays, the project continues to be a cornerstone of the nation's infrastructure development strategy, with the potential to transform the socioeconomic landscape of Nepal's mid-hill regions when completed.
