# Comprehensive Research on the Gautam Buddha International Airport Project in Nepal

The Gautam Buddha International Airport represents a significant milestone in Nepal's aviation infrastructure development, serving as the nation's second international airport and a gateway to the historically and culturally important Lumbini region.

## Basic Information

The infrastructure project is officially known as the Gautam Buddha International Airport (GBIA). It is also referred to as Gautam Buddha Airport (GBA) and Lumbini Airport, reflecting its proximity to Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha[^1][^2][^3]. This project is classified as an airport infrastructure development and became Nepal's second international airport when it opened in May 2022, after previously only handling domestic services[^2].

The project was developed as part of the South Asia Tourism Infrastructure Development Project (SATIDP), which aims to support inclusive growth through tourism development in Bangladesh, northwest states of India, and Nepal[^1]. While the search results don't explicitly state whether it's designated as a National Pride Project, its significance as only the second international airport in Nepal and its strategic location near the UNESCO World Heritage site of Lumbini indicate its national importance.

## Geographical Coverage

The Gautam Buddha International Airport is located in Bhairahawa, Rupandehi district of Nepal's Lumbini Province[^1][^2]. It serves the Lumbini area as well as the Butwal-Siddharthanagar urban agglomeration[^2]. The airport occupies a total land area of 543.78 hectares[^6].

In terms of capacity, the airport was designed to handle 750,000 passengers annually and accommodate 4,000 passengers per hour upon completion of the upgrading project[^3]. This significant capacity increase was intended to help alleviate pressure on Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, which was previously Nepal's only international airport.

## Timeline and Status

The project to transform the existing domestic airport into an international facility began taking shape in 2013, with initial plans aiming to have the upgraded airport operational by 2017 to relieve congestion at Tribhuvan International Airport[^6].

The foundation stone for the project was laid in January 2015 by then Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, with an initial projected completion date of December 2017[^3][^6]. However, the project faced multiple delays and deadline extensions:

- In 2017, the deadline was extended to 2019 due to the 2015 Nepal earthquake and the 2015 Nepal blockade[^6]
- In July 2019, the deadline was extended again to December 2019[^3][^6]
- Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the opening was postponed to March 2021[^6]
- In June 2021, the opening was further delayed until early 2022[^6]

The airport finally became operational in May 2022, marking Nepal's second international airport[^2]. As of July 2021, 100% of the physical structure work and 91% of aviation technical work had been completed[^3]. Most recently, in January 2023, the Required Navigation Performance-Authorization Required (RNP AR) system began operations at the airport[^5].

## Financial Details

The Gautam Buddha International Airport project was financed primarily through a loan and grant aid from the Asian Development Bank (ADB)[^6]. The financial analysis conducted for the project used a 20-year evaluation period from construction commencement, with a discount rate of 9%[^4].

The construction period for GBA was planned for 4 years[^4]. According to financial analysis, the project yielded a Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) of 7.7%, which exceeded the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 2.01%, indicating that the investment was financially viable[^4].

The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), which manages the airport, has shown positive financial performance in recent years. In fiscal year 2018, CAAN's annual revenue was NRs8,157.492 million, with cash profits increasing from NRs220 million in FY1999 to NRs4,306.549 million in FY2018[^4]. This positive financial trend suggested good potential for the financial sustainability of the airport project.

## Implementation Structure

The project implementation followed a clear organizational structure:

- Executing Agency: Government of Nepal, Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MOCTCA)[^1]
- Implementing Agency: Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN)[^1]
- Primary Contractor: Northwest Civil Aviation Airport Construction Group, a Chinese company that was awarded the contract in October 2014[^6]

The project was implemented as part of the broader South Asia Tourism Infrastructure Development Project (SATIDP) approved by ADB on November 16, 2009[^1]. This project aimed to develop high-priority tourism circuits of the sub-region, covering Paharpur area of Bangladesh, Sikkim of India, and Lumbini of Nepal[^1].

## Technical Specifications

The Gautam Buddha International Airport features significant technical specifications that meet international standards:

- Runway: 3,000 meters long by 45 meters wide (9,843 ft × 148 ft), with an asphalt concrete (bituminous paved) surface[^1][^2][^6]
- Runway designation: 10/28 with east-west orientation and a 200-meter Runway End Safety Area (RESA) on both sides[^2][^6]
- Parallel taxiway: 1,500 meters x 23 meters, previously used for domestic airplanes[^2][^6]

The airport is equipped with advanced navigational aids and airport lighting for safety and navigation, including:

- VHF omnidirectional range along with distance measuring equipment (DVOR/DME)[^2][^6]
- Required Area Navigation (RNAV/RNP)[^2][^6]
- Non-directional radio beacon (NDB) installed at the northern side of the airport[^2][^6]
- Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcasting (ADS-B) Sensor installed by CAAN to extend surveillance coverage[^2][^6]
- Instrument Landing System (ILS) to allow aircraft landing in reduced visibility, though it faces operational challenges[^6][^7]
- Required Navigation Performance-Authorization Required (RNP AR) system that began operations in January 2023[^5]
- Visual guidance system for aircraft parking[^2][^6]

The RNP AR system implemented at the airport is a Semi-Precision Approach, combining aspects of both conventional and precision approaches. Under this system, small aircraft need 800 meters of visibility and larger aircraft require 900 meters, compared to the previous requirement of 1,800 meters visibility for visual landings[^5].

## Socioeconomic Impact

The Gautam Buddha International Airport was designed to deliver significant socioeconomic benefits:

- Support for inclusive growth through tourism development in the sub-region[^1]
- Enhanced access to Lumbini, a world heritage site and birthplace of Lord Buddha, increasing international pilgrimage opportunities for Buddhist travelers[^1][^3]
- Development potential as an industrial hub for Bhairahawa and Butwal[^3]
- Reduced pressure on Tribhuvan International Airport, Nepal's previously sole international airport[^6]

The project is part of a broader initiative that includes upgrading airports and last-mile road connectivity, improving infrastructures and services of destinations, enhancing capacities of sector agencies for sustainable management of heritage sites, strengthening linkages between tourism and local people, and enhancing local communities' capacity to derive greater benefits from tourism[^1].

## Challenges and Controversies

The Gautam Buddha International Airport project faced numerous challenges during implementation and continues to encounter operational difficulties:

- Multiple delays during construction due to:
    - Political protests and border blockade[^3][^6]
    - The 2015 Nepal earthquake[^6]
    - Shortage of construction materials[^3]
    - Payment issues between Nepali and Chinese contractors[^3]
    - COVID-19 pandemic disruptions[^3][^6]

Current operational challenges include:

- Dense winter fog and low visibility issues that were reportedly not adequately addressed during planning[^7]
- Proximity to the Indian border (just 2 km from Indian airspace) complicating full utilization of the Instrument Landing System[^7]
- Airlines considering halting flights due to technical and strategic flaws in the airport's planning and construction[^7]
- Lack of comprehensive feasibility studies before construction, with criticism directed at the Asian Development Bank for insufficient technical and geopolitical analysis[^7]
- Airlines' reluctance to invest in pilot training and certification for the RNP AR technology due to low business viability[^7]


## Historical Context

The Gautam Buddha International Airport project evolved from an existing domestic airport that was upgraded to international standards. The development was part of a strategic initiative to address growing congestion at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, which had been Nepal's only international airport[^6].

The upgrade was conceived within the framework of the South Asia Tourism Infrastructure Development Project (SATIDP), which aimed to develop high-priority tourism circuits in the sub-region, covering Paharpur area of Bangladesh, Sikkim of India, and Lumbini of Nepal[^1]. This project aligned with broader regional tourism development goals while addressing Nepal's specific needs for expanded aviation infrastructure.

The contract to upgrade the airport was awarded to the Chinese company Northwest Civil Aviation Airport Construction Group in October 2014, with the foundation stone laid in January 2015[^6]. The project aimed to create a facility with a 3,000-meter runway and sixteen international parking bays, significantly expanding Nepal's international aviation capacity[^6].

## Future Outlook

Despite current operational challenges, there are continued development plans for the Gautam Buddha International Airport:

- The Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation has announced plans to build a new 35,000 m² international terminal for the airport[^6]
- The current terminal would be repurposed as a domestic terminal after the new international terminal is completed[^6]
- The new terminal is planned to include 4 sky-bridges, which the current terminal lacks[^6]

However, the airport faces significant operational uncertainties that need to be addressed:

- Airlines are considering halting flights due to technical and strategic flaws identified in the airport's planning and operation[^7]
- The RNP AR system implementation is gradual, and full operationalization may take time[^5]
- The proximity to Indian airspace continues to pose challenges for navigation systems[^7]

For the airport to fulfill its potential as Nepal's second international gateway and a catalyst for regional development, these technical and operational issues will need to be resolved through improved navigation systems, international cooperation (particularly with India), and strategic planning to address visibility challenges that affect flight operations.
