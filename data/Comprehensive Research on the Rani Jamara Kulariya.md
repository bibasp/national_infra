# Comprehensive Research on the Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The infrastructure project is officially known as the Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project. It is classified as an irrigation infrastructure project located in the far western region of Nepal. The project has been officially designated as one of Nepal's National Pride Projects, highlighting its strategic importance to the country's agricultural development and food security agenda[^1].

## Geographical Coverage

The Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project is located in Kailali district in the Sudurpashchim Province of Nepal. The intake of the project is positioned at Chisapani on the Karnali River[^1]. The project covers Tikapur Municipality, Janaki Rural Municipality, and Lamkichuha Municipality (formerly eight Village Development Committees: Pathariya, Durgouli, Janakinagar, Pratappur, Dhansinghpur, Narayanpur, Baliya, and Munuwa)[^2].

In terms of capacity, the project will ultimately provide irrigation facilities to 38,300 hectares of agricultural land, broken down as follows:

- Rani Jamara Kulariya irrigation system: 14,300 hectares
- Expansion of new branch canal (Lamki extension): 6,000 hectares
- Expansion of irrigated area from Pathariya to Kandra River: 18,000 hectares[^2]


## Timeline and Status

The Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project has an incremental history dating back decades:

- First initiation: 1953 BS (Bikram Sambat calendar) by Rani Padam Kumari Shah (Rani kulo pranali)[^1]
- Expansion in 1960 BS by Dhundi Raj Sahi (Jamara kulo pranali)[^1]
- Further expansion in 1972 BS by Madhu Mahato (Kulriya kulo pranali)[^1]
- Designation as National Pride Project: 2066 BS[^1]
- Modern project initiation: Fiscal year 2011/12[^2]
- Initial projected completion date: 2018/19[^2]
- Revised completion deadline: 2025/26[^2]

Current status as of March 2025:

- Initial testing of the irrigation canal was conducted in July 2019 (eight years after the project's initiation)[^2]
- Approximately 75% of the work scheduled for the current fiscal year has been completed[^2]
- Irrigation services have reached 20,000 hectares of land (out of the planned 38,300 hectares)[^2]
- Electricity generation of 4.71 MW has commenced, with connection to the national grid since January 2024[^2]
- About 34 kilometers of the main canal have been constructed[^2]


## Financial Details

The financial structure of the Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project has evolved significantly over time:

- Initial budget (approved February 2012): NPR 12.63 billion[^2]
- Current revised budget: NPR 29 billion[^2]

Funding sources:

- Government of Nepal: NPR 17.74 billion[^2]
- World Bank: NPR 9.95 billion (loan assistance)[^2]

As of February 2025, approximately NPR 20 billion (about 69% of the revised budget) has been spent on the project[^2]. The significant budget increase (from NPR 12.63 billion to NPR 29 billion) is attributed to infrastructure strengthening requirements, changes in compensation rates for land acquisition, and additional tasks such as the regulation of the Karnali, Mohana, and Pathariya rivers[^2].

## Implementation Structure

The implementation of the Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project involves several key stakeholders:

- Implementing agency: Department of Irrigation under the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources, and Irrigation[^3]
- Project information officer: Navin Paudel[^2]
- Community involvement: The project operates with significant community participation through the Rani Jamara Kulariya Water Consumers' Main Committee, chaired by Kumarraj Shahi[^2]

The contracts for the Rani, Jamara, and Kulariya sectors have been awarded separately to different contractors. While the work under the Jamara contract has been completed and 70% of the Kulariya sector is finished, the Rani sector has seen the least progress with Gauri Parvati Construction Services having completed only 38% of the allocated work[^2].

## Technical Specifications

The Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project features significant technical specifications:

- Main canal flow capacity: 100 cubic meters per second[^2]
- Main canal construction (34 kilometers total):
    - 8.875 kilometers from the intake to the new branch entrance
    - 10.60 kilometers of feeder canal from there to the source of the Rani canal system
    - 14.60 kilometers of canal extending westward to the Patharaiya River under the Lamki expansion[^2]

Major infrastructural components include:

- Three channel developments (Kuleria, Jamara, and Rani)
- 37 head regulators
- 143 hume pipe culverts
- 134 box culverts
- 220 vertical drop structures
- 21 outlets
- 53 aqueducts
- 3 bridges
- 1 siphon crossing[^1]

A notable technical achievement is the integration of hydropower generation, with 4.71 MW of electricity now being produced from three Kaplan turbines by dropping water approximately 7.5 meters from the Katase Canal[^2].

## Socioeconomic Impact

The Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project delivers significant socioeconomic benefits:

- Direct beneficiaries: Population of approximately 200,000 in Tikapur Municipality, Janaki Rural Municipality, and Lamkichuha Municipality[^2]
- Agricultural productivity: Paddy production has increased to 3.8 tonnes/ha from the national average of 3.5 tonnes/ha[^1]
- Electricity generation: 4.71 MW from the irrigation canal, now connected to the national grid[^2]
- Infrastructure development: Construction of a cold storage facility with a capacity of 1,000 metric tons in Tikapur[^2]

The project also includes a Vulnerable Community Development Plan (VCDP) to ensure that indigenous peoples and vulnerable communities benefit from the development[^3].

## Challenges and Controversies

The Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project has faced several significant challenges:

- Timeline extensions: The initial completion target of 2018/19 has been extended to 2025/26[^2]
- Budget increases: From NPR 12.63 billion to NPR 29 billion over approximately 14 years[^2]
- Contractor performance issues: Some contractors, particularly Gauri Parvati Construction Services in the Rani sector, have shown poor progress despite various levels of pressure[^2]
- Land use changes: Fragmentation of irrigated areas due to urbanization and industrial development, potentially compromising the project's agricultural benefits[^2]


## Historical Context

The Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation System has deep historical roots:

- Originally constructed by farmers of the Tharu community in stages:
    - Rani was built in 1896
    - Jamara in 1960
    - Kulariya in 1972[^3]
- The system is considered the first and largest irrigation canal in South Asia traditionally managed by the community[^2]
- Traditional maintenance was conducted through a community gathering called "Deshavar," where thousands of local residents would participate in canal digging and maintenance[^2]
- The modern Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project was initiated in 2011 to construct a multi-purpose modern structure while preserving the traditional irrigation system[^2]


## Future Outlook

As the project progresses toward its revised completion date of 2025/26, several key aspects remain in focus:

- Completion of remaining works, particularly in the Rani sector where only 38% of the work has been completed[^2]
- Expansion of irrigation coverage to the full planned 38,300 hectares (from the current 20,000 hectares)[^2]
- Continued integration of multi-purpose benefits, including irrigation, electricity generation, and agricultural infrastructure such as the cold storage facility[^2]

The Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project represents a significant investment in Nepal's agricultural infrastructure, with the potential to substantially improve agricultural productivity and livelihoods in the Kailali district upon completion. By combining modern engineering with community management traditions, the project exemplifies Nepal's approach to inclusive infrastructure development that respects historical practices while embracing technological advancements.
