# Comprehensive Research on the Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway

The Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway represents one of Nepal's most ambitious infrastructure endeavors, designed to revolutionize connectivity between the nation's capital and its southern plains. This research article provides a detailed examination of this critical national project.

## Basic Information

The project is officially known as the Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway, also referred to as the Kathmandu-Terai-Madhesh Expressway or Kathmandu-Tarai Fast Track. It is a high-speed expressway classified as primary class I according to Asian Highway Design Standard 1993[^2]. The expressway has been designated as a "National Pride Project" by the Government of Nepal, highlighting its strategic importance to the country's infrastructure development[^2].

## Geographical Coverage

The 70.977 km expressway (originally planned as 72.5 km but revised in the updated DPR) traverses four districts across two provinces[^1]. The geographical distribution includes:

- 3.9 km in Kathmandu district
- 6.9 km in Lalitpur district
- 55.7 km in Makawanpur district
- 6 km in Bara district[^2]

The expressway begins at Khokana in Lalitpur (km 0.0) and terminates at Nijgadh in Bara (km 70.977), creating a direct connection to the East-West Mahendra Highway[^1][^2]. The route features a corridor of four lanes through challenging hilly terrain[^2].

## Timeline and Status

**Conception and Planning:**

- Initially conceived during the Panchayat era (pre-1990)[^1][^7]
- First feasibility study conducted in 1992 by the National Planning Commission in collaboration with Danish Development Cooperation[^1]

- Current fiscal year: Rs 22.54 billion[^6]

**Financial Progress:**

- 39% financial completion as of February 2025[^8]

**Cost Reduction Claims:**

- Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Prakash Jwala claimed the project cost would be reduced by Rs 2 billion due to the shortened length, despite adding more tunnels and bridges[^1]


## Implementation Structure

**Implementing Agency:**

- Nepal Army (NA) has overall management responsibility since 2017[^3][^5][^7]

**Project Leadership:**

- Current Project Head: Major General Kamal Bikram Shah[^1][^8]
- Previous project leaders included Brigadier General Sharad Lal Shrestha[^4]

**Consulting Firms:**

- Korea-based Soosung Engineering and Consulting prepared the detailed project report (DPR)[^3]
- Korea-based Yooshin Engineering engaged as project consultant[^4]

**Contractors:**

- The project is divided into 13 packages[^2]
- Poli Chhangada Construction Company contracted for package number two, which includes the Dhedre tunnel[^5]
- International contractors required for 16 complex bridges; six companies (five Chinese and one Turkish) shortlisted[^3]


## Technical Specifications

**Design Features:**

- Width: 25 meters in hilly sections, 27 meters in plains[^1]
- Speed design: Not specified in available sources but classified as primary class I expressway

**Key Engineering Elements:**

- **Tunnels:** 6 tunnels totaling approximately 10.055 km[^1][^2]
    - Mahadevtar tunnel (3.355 km) - longest tunnel, 65% complete[^5]
    - Dhedre tunnel (1.691 km) - completed[^5]
    - Lane Danda tunnel (1.43 km) - completed[^5]
    - Debichaur tunnel (1 km) - added in revised DPR[^1]
    - Sisautar tunnel (0.39 km) - added in revised DPR[^1]
    - Chandram Bhir tunnel (2.25 km) - added in revised DPR[^1]
- **Bridges:** 89 bridges spanning approximately 12.885 km[^1][^2]
    - 85 bridges currently under construction[^6]
    - 4 bridges on hold due to land acquisition issues in Khokana[^6]
    - Only 2 bridges completed as of recent reports[^1]
- **Other Infrastructure:**
    - 3 interchanges (Khokana, Budune, Nijgadh)[^1]
    - 3 toll plazas (Khokana, Budune, Nijgadh)[^1]

**Environmental Measures:**

- 38,664 trees required to be felled (28,646 already cut)[^1]
- Replantation plan: 709,850 trees (643,695 already planted)[^1]


## Socioeconomic Impact

**Expected Benefits:**

- Reduce travel time between Kathmandu and Tarai to approximately one hour[^3]
- Serve as a bridge between Hill and Tarai regions, facilitating greater integration[^2]
- Provide better access to capital city facilities including education, healthcare, and employment opportunities for people from Tarai[^2]
- Facilitate faster transport of goods from Tarai (Nepal's "food bank") to Kathmandu[^2]
- Support development around the planned Nijgadh International Airport[^1]

- 371 ropanis still pending acquisition in Khokana-Bungmati section[^6]
- Demands for increased compensation from local residents[^3]

**Administrative Challenges:**

- Delays in approving the Detailed Project Report (took five months for Cabinet approval)[^3]
- Controversy in consultant selection process (initial selection scrapped after probe found selection criteria were leaked)[^4]
- Budget constraints (allocation reduced by half in fiscal year 2020-2021)[^4]
- COVID-19 pandemic impacts on project implementation[^4]

**Implementation Delays:**

- Inability to spend allocated budget in previous fiscal years (Rs 7 billion in one year and Rs 9 billion in another returned to state coffers)[^4]
- Project deadline extended multiple times (from 2021 to 2027)[^1][^3]
- Technical challenges in tunnel construction[^5]


## Historical Context

The expressway concept has a lengthy history spanning multiple political eras in Nepal. Initially conceived during the Panchayat system (pre-1990), the project remained dormant for years despite preliminary feasibility studies in 1992[^1][^7]. After the restoration of democracy, expressions of interest were invited in 1996, but little progress was made for over a decade amid political instability and armed conflict[^7].

The project gained renewed momentum in 2008 when the Asian Development Bank prepared a feasibility report. The Nepal Army initially opened the track in 2008-2011[^7]. Subsequently, the government sought international investors under a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) model. In 2015, an Indian consortium led by Infrastructure Leasing \& Financial Services (IL\&FS) was selected, but this decision was challenged in the Supreme Court, which ordered a halt to the process[^3][^7].

The subsequent government terminated all agreements with IL\&FS and decided in 2016-17 to develop the expressway using domestic resources[^7]. In August 2017, the project was officially handed over to the Nepal Army for implementation[^7].

## Future Outlook

Despite facing numerous challenges, the Nepal Army aims to complete the expressway by the end of 2083 BS (Nepali calendar, corresponding to 2026-2027 in the Gregorian calendar)[^8]. The project's completion will establish the fastest route between Kathmandu and the Tarai, potentially transforming trade, transportation, and regional development.

The remaining work focuses on:

- Completion of the Mahadevtar tunnel (approximately 35% remaining)[^5]
- Construction of three additional tunnels added in the revised DPR[^1]
- Construction of remaining bridges (87 out of 89 still incomplete)[^1]
- Resolution of land acquisition issues in Khokana[^1][^6]

Upon completion, the expressway is expected to significantly reduce transportation costs and time between Kathmandu and the southern plains, facilitating greater economic integration between these regions and potentially enhancing Nepal's trade capabilities with neighboring countries.
