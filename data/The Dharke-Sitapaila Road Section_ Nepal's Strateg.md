The road emerged from the need to develop alternative routes to the congested entry points to Kathmandu Valley:

- The Naubise-Nagdhunga road serves as the main gateway to Kathmandu for vehicles from the eastern, western, and southern parts of the country
- This 15-km section experiences massive traffic jams, with more than 8,000 vehicles passing through daily
- The Dharke-Sitapaila alignment offered an opportunity to develop a parallel route to reduce pressure on the existing corridor[^4]


### Previous Development Attempts

The road has a long but interrupted development history:

- Initial opening of the passage in 1987
- Decades of minimal maintenance and limited development
- Renewed focus on the route as Kathmandu's traffic congestion worsened and the need for alternative routes became more pressing[^4]


### Strategic Importance

The project gained momentum as part of broader plans to improve Kathmandu's accessibility:

- Recognition of the need for redundant transportation corridors to the capital
- Plans to upgrade the Nagdhunga-Mugling road to four lanes created additional urgency for alternative routes
- Integration with Nepal's overall transportation strategy focusing on developing multiple access corridors to major urban centers[^4]


## Future Outlook

### Remaining Work

As of March 2025, the remaining work appears to be focused on:

- Completion of final blacktopping layers on remaining sections
- Installation of road safety features and signage
- Finishing touches on drainage systems and supporting infrastructure[^1][^5]


### Connected Projects

The Dharke-Sitapaila road project is strategically connected to other transportation initiatives:

- It will serve as a crucial alternative during the planned four-lane expansion of the Nagdhunga-Mugling road
- It complements the Nagdhunga Tunnel Construction Project, which aims to improve another section of the Kathmandu Valley's western access
- Together with other alternative routes, it forms part of a network approach to addressing Kathmandu's accessibility challenges[^4]


### Long-term Development Vision

Within Nepal's broader infrastructure development strategy, this project represents:

- A shift toward developing multiple redundant transportation corridors to major urban centers
- Recognition of the need for alternative routes to enhance network resilience
- A step toward comprehensive transportation planning that anticipates future growth and development needs
- A practical approach to addressing immediate congestion issues while longer-term, larger-scale projects like tunnel highways are being developed[^4][^6]

The Dharke-Sitapaila road section, once fully completed, will play a vital role in reducing congestion at one of Kathmandu's main entry points while providing a more reliable alternative transportation corridor. Its significance extends beyond local connectivity, contributing to Nepal's broader strategy of developing a more resilient and comprehensive transportation network.
