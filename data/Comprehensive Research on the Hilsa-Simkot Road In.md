# Comprehensive Research on the Hilsa-Simkot Road Infrastructure Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The official name of this infrastructure project is the Hilsa-Simikot Road Project. It is also referred to as part of the broader Karnali Corridor initiative[^3][^5]. This project is classified as a highway/road infrastructure project and serves as a critical transportation link in the remote northwestern region of Nepal. The Hilsa-Simikot Road forms a vital segment of the Karnali Corridor, which has been officially designated as a National Pride Project by the Government of Nepal[^3].

## Geographical Coverage

The Hilsa-Simikot Road is located in Humla district in Karnali Province, one of Nepal's most remote regions. The highway connects Simikot (the district headquarters of Humla) to Hilsa at the Nepal-China border. The total length of the road from Hilu on the Tibetan border to Simikot via Hilsa is approximately 95 kilometers[^1].

This road serves as a critical northern section of the larger Karnali Corridor, which spans approximately 682 kilometers from Jamunah in Banke (at the Indian border) through Surkhet, Dailekh, Kalikot, and Bajura to reach Hilsa at the Chinese border[^5]. The section from Hilsa to Salisalla alone covers 146 kilometers[^5].

## Timeline and Status

The construction timeline of the Hilsa-Simikot Road has faced numerous delays and challenges:

- The project had been halted for approximately one and a half years around 2015-16 due to a lack of explosive materials needed for rock blasting at the Chyachada road section[^1].
- The Nepal Army began construction work in March 2015 (Chait 5, 2071 BS) following a cabinet decision tasking them with building the Khulalu–Simikot road under special circumstances[^3].
- The Army handed over the completed 196.3-kilometer section from Khulalu in Kalikot to Simikot in Humla to the Department of Roads on July 15, 2021[^5].

Current status as of early 2024:

- The Simikot-Hilsa road was temporarily closed due to accelerated construction work in the Chaarara section[^4].
- Despite substantial progress, seven land disputes near Humla's Simikot have delayed the completion of approximately 700 meters of road connecting Hilsa to Simikot[^3].
- Some sections have been completed, with vehicles operating on the newly opened tracks, though not all sections are fully operational year-round[^3][^5].


## Financial Details

The financial information available about the project includes:

- A multi-year contract worth Rs 4.23 billion was issued on February 14, 2024, for upgrading and blacktopping the Khulalu–Sallisalla section, covering 50 kilometers in two segments from Pilichaur in Bajura to Chumcha in Humla[^3].
- Six contracts worth Rs 60 million were previously awarded for road improvements, repairs, gabion walls, and gravel work for 60 kilometers from Khulalu to Bajura[^3].
- The current fiscal year has allocated Rs 112 million for upgrading the road from Pilichaur in Bajura to Kuwadi Khola in Humla[^3].
- A contract worth Rs 34 million has been awarded for road maintenance and improvements on the 146 kilometers from Sallisalla to Hilsa along the Karnali Corridor[^3].

The project has faced budget shortages that contributed to construction delays, with the Nepal Army extending their initial five-year deadline due to these financial constraints and the impact of COVID-19[^3].

## Implementation Structure

The implementation of the Hilsa-Simikot Road involves several key entities:

- The Nepal Army was initially tasked with constructing the road, particularly challenging sections requiring significant blasting work[^1][^3].
- The Department of Roads later took over responsibility for certain completed sections, with the Hilsa-Simikot Road Project operating under its authority[^5].
- Key personnel include:
    - Belbahadur Nepali, Head of the Hilsa–Simikot Project in Humla[^3][^4]
    - Tularam Sharma, Chief of the Karnali Corridor Khulalu–Sallisalla Road Project[^3]
    - Oasis Engineering and Builders is involved in construction work with fifty workers deployed for manual construction in difficult sections[^4]


## Technical Specifications

The Hilsa-Simikot Road project faces significant technical challenges due to the extreme terrain:

- Construction through rocky mountain areas required substantial use of explosives, with the Nepal Army supplying 3,000kg of explosive materials to clear rocks at the Chyachada road section[^1].
- Difficult sections include the Chyachhara area, where intensive construction work has necessitated road closures[^4].
- The project includes the construction of multiple bridges, including bailey bridges at critical water crossings such as Chuwa Khola in Humla's Kharpunath[^3].
- A Chinese company, China Railway Irwan Engineering Company, prepared a Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the broader Karnali Corridor, recommending varying road specifications: six-lane from Dhuliyabit to Kapase, four-lane in market and settlement areas, and three-lane in other areas[^2].


## Socioeconomic Impact

The Hilsa-Simikot Road project has already begun delivering significant socioeconomic benefits:

- The road will dramatically reduce transportation costs for Mansarovar pilgrims, from approximately Rs 80,000 per person by helicopter to around Rs 10,000 by road[^1].
- Local trade has improved, with residents now able to transport goods from Taklakot in Tibet using vehicles on the newly opened road sections[^1].
- The previously two-day journey between Simikot and Hilsa will be significantly reduced[^1].
- Economic activity has increased along the corridor, with multiple locations developing into market centers, including Khulalu, Lalighat, Regil, Shantighat, Bhurabgar, Bhattadi, Ghatparichaur, Jitegada, Jarkot, Kolti Pilichaur, and Dhulachaur[^5].
- Agricultural marketing has improved, with farmers now able to sell products like apples that previously went to waste[^5].
- New income opportunities have emerged, with locals establishing businesses like hotels in market areas along the corridor[^5].


## Challenges and Controversies

The project has encountered numerous challenges:

- Lack of explosive materials halted construction for approximately one and a half years around 2015-16[^1].
- Seven land disputes near Humla's Simikot have delayed the completion of approximately 700 meters of road[^3].
- Budget shortages have consistently slowed progress, forcing timeline extensions[^3].
- The COVID-19 pandemic further delayed construction activities[^3].
- Extreme terrain, particularly rocky sections like Chyachhara, has posed significant engineering challenges[^4].
- Seasonal challenges affect usability, with vehicles unable to cross certain sections like Chuwa Khola during monsoon season[^3].
- High transportation costs remain an issue despite road improvements, with residents paying up to Rs 4,000 to travel from Sarke Gad to Surkhet[^3].


## Historical Context

While detailed historical context is limited in the search results, key points include:

- The Karnali Corridor concept, which encompasses this road project, was established approximately 21-23 years ago (around 2002-2004)[^5].
- The project gained significant momentum in 2015 when the Cabinet officially tasked the Nepal Army with its construction[^3].
- The completion of this road will make Humla the final district in Nepal to be connected to the national road network, representing a milestone in the country's infrastructure development[^2].


## Future Outlook

The future outlook for the Hilsa-Simikot Road includes:

- Completion of remaining challenging sections, particularly the final 700 meters affected by land disputes[^3].
- Continued upgrading and blacktopping of completed sections to improve road quality and reduce transportation costs[^3].
- Integration into the broader Karnali Corridor initiative, enhancing connectivity between India and China through Nepal[^5].
- Further development of market centers along the route, stimulating local economies[^5].
- Potential for increased tourism, particularly for Mansarovar pilgrims who will benefit from reduced transportation costs[^1].
- Improved year-round accessibility once seasonal challenges are addressed through bridge construction and road improvements[^3].

The Hilsa-Simikot Road represents a crucial component of Nepal's strategy to improve connectivity in remote regions and enhance cross-border trade with China. Despite numerous challenges, the project's progression demonstrates Nepal's commitment to developing comprehensive transportation infrastructure even in its most geographically challenging regions.
