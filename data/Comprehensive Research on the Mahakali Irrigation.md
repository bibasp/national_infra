# Comprehensive Research on the Mahakali Irrigation Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The Mahakali Irrigation Project is officially recognized as one of Nepal's National Pride Projects. It is classified as an irrigation infrastructure project designed to divert water from the Mahakali River at the Sharada Barrage to irrigate agricultural lands in western Nepal[^1]. While the search results don't mention a specific project ID, its designation as a National Pride Project underscores its strategic importance to Nepal's agricultural development and food security agenda.

## Geographical Coverage

The Mahakali Irrigation Project covers two districts in western Nepal: Kanchanpur and Kailali[^1][^2]. The project's command area encompasses 33,520 hectares of agricultural land across these districts[^2][^3]. The headworks of the project is the Sharada Barrage, which was constructed in 1928 by the British-Indian government[^1]. The project involves a planned 151-kilometer main canal on the Nepal side, with multiple branch and minor canals extending from it[^3][^4]. The starting portion of the canal near the barrage, approximately 1 kilometer in length, lies inside Indian territory in land that was granted to British India during historical treaties[^1].

## Timeline and Status

The development of the Mahakali Irrigation Project has progressed through several distinct phases:

- Initial development: The main canal of the project was first constructed in 1975 with a command area of 3,400 hectares[^1]
- Stage I: Financing agreement signed with the International Development Association on September 29, 1980, with a 5-year implementation period; completed in 1988[^1][^4]
- Stage II: Agreement signed on November 18, 1988, between Nepal and the International Development Association; completed in 1997[^1]
- Stage III: Proposed during the Mahakali Treaty between Nepal and India signed on February 12, 1996; actual construction initiated in 2063 BS (2006)[^1][^2]

Current status:

- Physical progress stands at only 22% despite 18 years of implementation[^2][^3]
- Only 28.9 kilometers of the planned 151-kilometer main canal has been constructed[^1][^3]
- According to a decision made on February 11, 2021, the canal extension to Malakheti in Kailali is expected to be completed by the fiscal year 2030/31[^3]


## Financial Details

The financial structure of the Mahakali Irrigation Project reveals significant underinvestment:

- Initial estimated cost: Rs 35 billion[^2][^3]
- Amount spent to date: Rs 7.68 billion (approximately 22% of the estimated cost)[^2][^3]
- Current allocation: Rs 2 billion for the current fiscal year, described by project engineers as inadequate[^3]

Funding sources:

- Stages I and II were funded through agreements with the International Development Association[^1][^4]
- Stage III appears to be funded through government budget allocations[^2][^3]


## Implementation Structure

The implementation of the Mahakali Irrigation Project involves several entities:

- Mahakali, Pathraiya, Mohana Irrigation Management Division (MPMIMD) under the Department of Irrigation appears to oversee the main canal operations[^4]
- Water Users Association (WUA) is involved in operating and maintaining the transferred systems below the main canal through the Irrigation Management Transfer component[^4]
- Senior Engineer Lekhnath Subedi is identified as a key official for the Mahakali Irrigation-third phase project[^2][^3]


## Technical Specifications

The Mahakali Irrigation Project incorporates several technical elements:

- Water allocation: Nepal can draw 28.35 m³/s of flow from the Sharada Barrage during the wet season (May 15 to October 15) and 4.25 m³/s in the dry season (October 16 to May 14) as per the Mahakali Treaty[^1]
- Main canal design discharge: 28.35 m³/s (1000 cusecs)[^4]
- Canal system structure: Hierarchical design with main canal, branch canals, secondary canals, and tertiary canals[^4]
- Command area organization: The command area of MIS-I is divided into 5 blocks (A-E), and MIS-II is divided into 4 blocks (5-8)[^4]


## Socioeconomic Impact

The Mahakali Irrigation Project aims to deliver significant agricultural benefits:

- Target beneficiaries: Farmers cultivating 33,520 hectares of land in Kanchanpur and Kailali districts[^2][^3]
- Current agricultural situation: Only 43% of rice fields in Kanchanpur had paddy planted by mid-July due to inadequate irrigation facilities[^3]
- Land utilization: Only 59,602 hectares out of 161,741 hectares of arable land in Kanchanpur are currently being farmed[^3]


## Challenges and Controversies

The Mahakali Irrigation Project has faced several significant challenges:

- Extremely slow progress: Only 22% physical completion after 18 years of implementation[^2][^3]
- Budget constraints: Annual allocations are consistently inadequate, with only Rs 2 billion provided for the current fiscal year[^3]
- Compensation disputes: Unresolved issues regarding land compensation have hindered progress[^3]
- Forest land usage challenges: Difficulties related to utilizing forest land for canal construction[^3]
- International coordination issues: Water has not been released in the completed 28-kilometer canal because the Indian side requires a formal inauguration before water supply begins[^2][^3]


## Historical Context

The Mahakali Irrigation Project has deep historical roots:

- Colonial origins: The headworks (Sharada Barrage) was constructed in 1928 by the British-Indian government[^1]
- Diplomatic framework: The third stage was proposed as part of the "Treaty for Integrated Development of Mahakali Barrage including Sharada Barrage, Tanakpur Barrage and Pancheshwar Multi-purpose Project" signed between Nepal and India on February 12, 1996[^1]
- Implementation evolution: The project has progressed through three stages spanning several decades[^1]


## Future Outlook

Despite challenges, the project continues to move forward:

- Current contracts: Agreements were recently signed to build a canal section from 28.8 kilometers to 48.3 kilometers in five separate packages[^3]
- Near-term goals: The 22 branch canals being built around the main canal are expected to irrigate 5,200 hectares by the next fiscal year[^3]
- Extended timeline: The canal extension to Malakheti in Kailali is projected for completion by fiscal year 2030/31[^3]
- Overall objective: Once completed, the project aims to provide irrigation to the full 33,520 hectares across Kailali and Kanchanpur districts[^3]

The Mahakali Irrigation Project represents a critical component of Nepal's agricultural infrastructure development, though its implementation timeline has been significantly extended due to various challenges.
