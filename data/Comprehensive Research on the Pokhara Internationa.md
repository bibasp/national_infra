# Comprehensive Research on the Pokhara International Airport Infrastructure Project in Nepal

## Basic Information

The official name of this infrastructure project is the Pokhara Regional International Airport (PRIA)[^1]. It is also commonly referred to as Pokhara International Airport and appears in some documentation with the IATA code PHH and ICAO code VNPR[^2]. This is an airport infrastructure project classified as an aviation facility. The project is listed among Nepal's National Pride Projects, highlighting its strategic importance to the country's development agenda[^2].

## Geographical Coverage

The Pokhara International Airport is located in the Kaski district of Gandaki Province in western Nepal[^1]. Specifically, the airport is situated on the hillside at Chhinne Danda in Pokhara, approximately 800 meters above sea level[^1]. It is positioned 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) east of the old domestic airport, which it is gradually replacing[^2].

The airport occupies a 200-hectare (494.2-acre) site that was acquired by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) in 1974[^1]. The location is well-connected to the Prithvi Highway that links Kathmandu and Pokhara[^1]. In terms of capacity, the airport is designed to handle approximately one million passengers annually[^1][^2].

## Timeline and Status

The development of the Pokhara International Airport followed these key milestones:

- Ground-breaking ceremony: April 2016[^1]
- Construction commencement: July 2017[^1]
- Construction completion: 2022[^1]
- Official inauguration and operations commencement: January 1, 2023, with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal presiding over the ceremony[^3]

The airport is currently fully operational, though as of early 2023, international flights had not yet begun regular service despite the airport's international designation[^2]. STOL (Short Take-Off and Landing) operations to Jomsom continue to be operated from the old airport[^2].

## Financial Details

The financial structure of the Pokhara International Airport reveals significant economic challenges:

- Annual revenue target: Rs 300 million as projected by the Pokhara Regional International Airport Office[^4]
- Annual loan repayment obligation: Rs 2.4 billion (principal plus interest)[^4]
- Funding source: Loan from the Chinese Exim Bank, provided through the Government of Nepal to the Civil Aviation Authority[^3][^4]
- Loan terms: Seven-year grace period (ending in 2023), followed by semi-annual installments of Rs 1.2 billion for a total of 20 years until Ashoj 1, 2092 (Nepali calendar)[^4]
- First installment: Rs 1.2 billion due on March 15, 2023[^4]

The significant gap between projected revenue and loan repayment obligations has raised concerns about financial sustainability. However, the Civil Aviation Authority has noted that they have an accumulated profit of Rs 1465.3 billion, which could potentially cover installments if necessary[^4]. Additionally, the Ministry of Finance is prepared to cover payment shortfalls[^4].

## Implementation Structure

The implementation of the Pokhara International Airport involved several key stakeholders:

- Implementing agency: Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN)[^1][^4]
- Project spokesperson: Jashodha Subedi (airport office) and Gyanendra Bhul (information officer at CAAN)[^4]
- Chinese support: The project received loan assistance from the Chinese government and falls within China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) according to the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu[^3]

The search results don't specifically identify the primary contractors or consulting firms involved in the construction.

## Technical Specifications

The Pokhara International Airport was designed and built according to rigorous international standards:

- Design standards: Category 4D standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), International Air Transport Association (IATA), and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)[^1]
- Runway specifications: 2.5km-long and 45m-wide runway with a 330m runway strip, capable of supporting Airbus A320, Boeing 737-700 series, and Boeing 757-200 aircraft[^1][^5]
- Taxiway: 1.2km × 23m parallel taxiway built from the runway central line on the north side[^1]
- Terminal facilities: 10,000-square-meter international terminal capable of handling 650 passengers per hour, and a 4,000-square-meter domestic terminal[^2][^5]
- Aircraft parking: Three parking bays for A320-type jets with aerobridge facilities and five parking bays for ATR-type aircraft[^5]

Navigation aids include:

- VHF omnidirectional range with distance measuring equipment (VOR/DME)[^2]
- Required Area Navigation (RNAV/RNP)[^2]
- CAT-I Instrument Landing System (ILS) (operational after February 26, 2023)[^2]
- High-intensity 870-meter extended centerline lights at the southern end to assist with approaches[^2]
- Wide area multilateration (WAM) based surveillance system (the first of its kind in Nepal)[^2]


## Socioeconomic Impact

The Pokhara International Airport is expected to deliver significant socioeconomic benefits to Nepal:

- Enhanced regional connectivity: The airport enables direct connectivity to South and East Asian countries and serves as a gateway to the Himalayan and Annapurna regions[^1]
- Tourism development: As Pokhara is Nepal's tourism capital, the airport is expected to significantly boost tourist arrivals by enabling direct international flights[^6]
- Trade facilitation: The airport could serve as a key facilitator of imports and exports for local businesses[^6]
- Economic stimulus: Increased tourist and passenger traffic through the airport is anticipated to stimulate overall district demand, particularly in the hospitality sector[^6]
- Employment generation: The operation of the airport creates numerous jobs both internally through employment within the airport itself and externally through related sectors such as trade, hotels, transport, postal services, warehousing, and manufacturing[^6]
- Investment attraction: The airport is expected to enhance the attractiveness of Pokhara for business investors, potentially establishing the area as a business hub[^6]


## Challenges and Controversies

The primary challenge facing the Pokhara International Airport is financial sustainability:

- The annual projected revenue of Rs 300 million falls significantly short of the Rs 2.4 billion annual loan repayment obligation[^4]
- Despite being designated as an international airport, as of early 2023, the facility was primarily handling domestic flights, limiting its revenue potential[^4]
- The search results mention a tragic incident on January 15, 2023, when Yeti Airlines Flight 691 crashed on approach to the airport, resulting in 72 fatalities. This accident was attributed to pilot error rather than airport infrastructure issues[^2]


## Historical Context

The Pokhara International Airport represents a significant upgrade to Nepal's aviation infrastructure:

- The new facility replaced the previous Pokhara Airport, which had been in operation since July 1958[^1]
- It became Nepal's third international airport, following Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu (71 years old) and Gautam Buddha International Airport in Bhairawa (inaugurated in May 2022)[^3]
- The project agreement between the Nepal government and the Chinese bank was established in 2072 BS (approximately 2015-2016 in the Gregorian calendar)[^4]
- The project was initiated partly in response to the limitations of the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, which faced frequent closures due to poor visibility conditions[^6]


## Future Outlook

The future development of the Pokhara International Airport focuses on establishing international operations and achieving financial sustainability:

- The airport aims to attract international service companies through incentives, including a 100% discount on parking and other services for one year, as well as a 50% discount on ground handling services[^3]
- Once fully operational with international flights, the airport is expected to significantly reduce air traffic at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu[^5]
- The strategic location will give international tourists options to land directly in Pokhara, closer to their final destinations in the Annapurna region[^5]
- The airport is positioned to serve as an alternative to Tribhuvan International Airport in emergency situations[^1]
- Buddha Air has announced plans to construct a hangar capable of accommodating aircraft up to the size of an Airbus A319[^2]

As the airport continues to develop its operations, it represents a critical component of Nepal's broader strategy to improve its aviation infrastructure, enhance tourism, and stimulate regional economic development in the Pokhara and Annapurna regions.
